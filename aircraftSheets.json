Early design work for what would become the Jetcruzer 450 began in 1983. Construction of an Allison 250-C20S powered prototype began in 1988. It flew for the first time on January 11 1989.\r\n\r\nThe preproduction prototype first flew April 1991, and the first production standard Jetcruzer 450 on September 13 1992. When FAA Part 23 certification was granted on June 14 1994 the Jetcruzer became the first aircraft in the world to be certificated as spin resistant.\r\n\r\nAASI elected not to place the 450 into production and instead focused its efforts on the pressurised 500. Initial work was on the 500P, which featured a modest 25cm (10in) fuselage stretch, but AASI instead decided to enlarge the design further. The definitive Jetcruzer features a 1.83m (6ft) fuselage stretch over the 450 (increasing cabin length by 90cm (3ft), plus a significantly more powerful PT6A66 turboprop driving a five (rather than three) blade prop, pressurisation to 30,000ft, an airstair entry door on the right hand side and additional cabin windows.\r\n\r\nFirst flight of the prototype 500 (the modified preproduction prototype 450) was in August 22 1997, followed by the second prototype (the modified production 450) on November 7 1997. \r\n\r\nOther notable Jetcruzer 500 design features include its canard configuration (which allows the main wing to be positioned further aft than normal, so the wing spars do not intrude into the cabin), lack of flaps (reducing pilot work load and manufacturing costs and saving weight), and optional EFIS avionics. Like the 450 the 500 will be certificated as spin resistant. The fuselage is made from composites while the wing and canard are aluminium.\r\n\r\nOn February 8 2002, AASI announced that it was taking over the Mooney assets, and that the name Mooney would be used for the combined companies. Headquarters, development, and marketing would remain at AASI's facility at Long Beach in California, but production of the Jetcruzer would be at Mooney's Kerrville, Texas plant. \r\n\r\nThe company is also working on the Stratocruzer 1250, a 13 place twin WilliamsRolls FJ-44 powered light corporate jet development.\r\n\r\n"}, {"relatedLinks": "AEA Explorer", "capacity": "350R - Seating for nine (including pilot) in a passenger configuration.

It is designed to fill a market gap between the Cessna 206 Stationair and the much larger Cessna 208 Caravan utility singles. \r\n\r\nAEA's managing director Graham Swannell first began looking at a new utility aircraft in the late 1980s, and initially considered developing a stretched and more powerful Cessna 206 conversion which would have been covered by a supplemental type certificate. But by 1993 Swannell had started design work on an all new aircraft, a 10 seater powered by an eight cylinder 300kW (400hp) Textron Lycoming IO-720. This design then evolved to become the Explorer 350R, a nine-seater powered by a Teledyne Continental TSIO-550 flat-six. \r\n\r\nThe 350R flew for the first time on January 23 1998. Apart from its TSIO-550 engine driving a three blade prop, design features include a metal frame fuselage with a carbonfibre shell, conventional all metal wings and tail surfaces and retractable undercarriage. The main undercarriage retraction system is uncommon - the legs, which are made from fibreglass, extend further downwards before crossing each other below the fuselage with the wheels coming to rest in pods on the opposite side of the fuselage - thus not intruding into the main cabin. \r\n\r\nThe aircraft's basic configuration is optimised for its intended utility roles, with a high mounted, braced wing, rectangular and constant section, flat floor cabin, and large cabin windows. \r\n\r\nThe Explorer 350R will not be built in series, but is the proof-of-concept (POC) prototype for a family of utility aircraft. The 350R prototype was  converted to the 500T prototype, powered by a 600shp Pratt & Whitney PT6A-135B turboprop, and the first flight as such was made on June 9 2000. The 500T has seating for eleven (including the pilot) in a passenger configuration, and will be the entry level aircraft for the Explorer. A second production version will be the 500R, a 600hp Orenda OE-600A piston engine powered version of the 500T. A 2.21m (7ft 3in) stretched version is planned, the Explorer 750T, which will seat 17 (including the pilot), and will be powered by a 750shp Pratt & Whitney PT6A-60A turboprop.\r\n\r\nOn May 20 1999 the 350R left Australia for a promotional tour of the USA, and will now be further developed and taken into production in the United States by Explorer Aircraft Inc, located in Jasper, Texas.\r\n\r\n"}, {"relatedLinks": "Aermacchi F-260", "capacity": "Typical seating for two side by side, plus rear seat capable of seating one adult or two small children.", "dimensions": "SF-260A - Wing span over tip tanks 8.40m (27ft 7in), length 7.02m (23ft 0in), height 2.60m (8ft 6in).

It was originally flown in 185kW (250hp) Lycoming O-540 powered form by the Aviamilano company as the F-250. However until its takeover by Aermacchi in 1997 SIAI-Marchetti undertook all production (initially under licence, before later assuming full responsibility for the program) of the aircraft as the 195kW (260hp) O-540 powered SF-260. The second aircraft to fly was the first built by SIAI-Marchetti and the first powered by the more powerful version of the O-540. This second prototype first flew in 1966. \r\n\r\nThe initial civil production models were the SF-260 and SF-260A, and a number were sold in the USA as the Waco Meteor. In 1974 production switched to the SF-260B with improvements first developed for the military SF-260M, including a stronger undercarriage, a redesigned wing leading edge and a taller fin. The B was soon followed by the further improved SF-260C, with increased span wing. \r\n\r\nWhile the SF-260 has been further developed into E and F forms these have been sold to military operators only. The 260kW (350shp) Allison (now Rolls-Royce) 250-B17D turboprop powered SF-260TP meanwhile has been built since the early 1980s, but it too has been sold only to military customers. Nevertheless Italian civil certification was awarded in October 1993, opening the door for possible civil sales. \r\n\r\nIn civil use the SF-260 is now regarded as something of a classic thoroughbred. Its clean aerodynamic lines, retractable undercarriage and relatively powerful engine guarantee spirited performance. \r\n\r\nIn 1997 Aermacchi took over SIAI-Marchetti and continues to market the aircraft as the F-260, with low rate production continuing against military orders. \r\n\r\n"}, {"relatedLinks": "Aero Boero AB-95/115/150/180", "capacity": "Accommodation for one pilot and two passengers, or three/four passengers in initial AB-180 model.

The 11CC was certificated in May 1948, and its float-equipped equivalent, the S11CC, in October 1948.\r\n\r\nIn 1951 Aeronca stopped production of light aircraft, as the market for light aircraft was not profitable anymore and as they had large orders for Korean War equipment to fulfill.\r\n\r\nE.J.Trytek acquired the rights for the Model 11, but did not build the Chief themselves. The 11CC was however licence-built in India as the Hindustan HUL-26 Pushpak with a 67kW (90hp) Continental C-90 engine. The first flight was made on September 28 1958, and the type was produced until 1968.

The more powerful Astazou engine conferred better hot and high performance and improved fuel economy. The SA-319 entered production in 1968 as the SA-319B. \r\n\r\nThe SA-319B and SA-316B remained in production side by side through the 1970s and into the early 1980s.

This resulted in the Nord N-262, which first flew on December 24 1962. \r\n\r\nProduction of the N-262 consisted of four major variants, the initial production N-262A with Turbom\u00e9ca Bastan VIC engines; N-262B, of which only four were specially converted on request of Air Inter, also with Bastan VI engines; the N-262C Fregate with more powerful Bastan VIIC engines and greater wing span; and the N-262D Fregate, the French Air Force equivalent of the N-262C. \r\n\r\nThe merger of Nord and Sud during the N-262's production life resulted in it becoming a product of Aerospatiale from 1970. \r\n\r\nIn the late 1970s US commuter airline Allegheny Airlines - through its subsidiary Mohawk Air Services - extensively upgraded its fleet of N-262s, subcontracting the conversions to Frakes Aviation, resulting in the Mohawk 298 (the designation being derived from the FAA FAR Part 298 airworthiness regulation). The retrofit involved reengining the 262s with more powerful Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-45 turboprops with five blade props, new avionics and a new APU. \r\n\r\nThe first Mohawk 298 flew on January 7 1975, while the last of nine converted was completed in 1978. \r\n\r\nProduction of the N-262 ended in 1976.\r\n\r\n"}, {"relatedLinks": "Aerospatiale SA-330 Puma", "capacity": "Crew of one or two pilots on flightdeck, plus jumpseat.

The Concorde is the only aircraft in the world operating scheduled passenger flights at supersonic speed. \r\n\r\nAn engineering masterpiece, the Concorde was the result of a collaborative venture between the aviation industries of Britain and France. It dates back to design work for a supersonic airliner carried out by Sud Aviation and Bristol, their respective Super Caravelle and Bristol 233 designs being remarkably similar in configuration to each other. The forecast high costs of any SST program and the similarities in the designs led to a 1962 government agreement between France and Britain which resulted in the British Aircraft Corporation (into which Bristol had been merged) and SudAviation (which became a part of Aerospatiale in 1970) joining to design and develop such an aircraft. \r\n\r\nTalks with airlines in the 1960s resulted in a relatively long range aircraft design capable of flying trans Atlantic sectors (although for a time Sud offered a short haul version). Design of the airframe was refined to feature a highly complex delta wing featuring cambering and ogival leading edges with pairs of engines mounted in pods under the wing undersurface. The slender fuselage features a high fineness ratio to keep supersonic drag to a minimum, while the fuel system was designed to trim the aircraft longitudinally by transferring fuel between tanks to combat the change in the centre of pressure as the aircraft accelerates. Another feature is the variable geometry nose which is lowered while taxying, on takeoff and landing to improve the flightcrew's visibility. \r\n\r\nA lengthy development program following the Concorde's first flight on March 2 1969 meant that it did not enter into airline service until January 1976.\r\n\r\nOn May 30 2003 the last commercial Air France flight landed back at Paris Charles de Gaulle from New York. The very last flight for Air France was made on June 27 2003 when F-BVFC flew from Paris to its place of construction in Toulouse for preservation.\r\n\r\nBritish Airways hoped to operate Concorde services well into the first decade of the new century, but will now terminate its supersonic services in October 2003.

A second prototype flew later in that same year. Agusta originally aimed to gain certification for the A-119 in late 1996 but this was delayed until late 1998. One cause for the delay has been strong sales demand for the A-109E Power, another to enhance the A-119's performance in response to customer feedback. Production deliveries are planned for 1999. \r\n\r\nThe Koala's big selling feature is its large 'widebody' fuselage. Agusta says the cabin is 30% larger than the cabins of any other current production single engine helicopter. A measure of the cabin size is that it can accommodate two stretcher patients in an EMS role, along with two medical attendants. Most other single engine helicopters typically are only equipped for a single stretcher because of a lack of space (Agusta sees medical retrieval operators as prime potential Koala customers). \r\n\r\nAccess to the main cabin is via two large sliding doors, one either side of the fuselage. A baggage compartment in the rear of the fuselage is also accessible in flight. \r\n\r\nThe first prototype Koala was powered by a Turbom\u00e9ca Arriel 1 turboshaft but it was subsequently reengined with a 747kW (1002shp) takeoff rated Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6B-37, which powered the second prototype and will feature in production aircraft. Another design feature is the Koala's composite four blade main rotor which features a titanium fully articulated maintenance free hub with elastomeric bearings and composite grips. \r\n\r\n"}, {"relatedLinks": "Air Tractor series", "capacity": "One pilot and for AT-503A and AT-802 passenger or observer.

The AE31X program arose out of earlier Chinese and South Korean studies for a 100 seater and a framework agreement covering its development was signed in May 1997. However on September 3 1998 Airbus announced termination of the project saying it was not economically viable. \r\n\r\nThe AE31X would have flown in mid 2002 and entered service in mid 2003. Final assembly would have been undertaken at Xian in China by Xian Aircraft Company. \r\n\r\nEven before the cancellation of the AE31X program Airbus had been independently studying a minimum change 100 seat derivative of the A319 covered by the A319M5 designation (M5 = minus five fuselage frames). Following the AE31X's cancellation Airbus announced the commercial launch of the A319M5 as the A318 at the 1998 Farnborough Airshow. \r\n\r\nAirbus announced the A318's industrial launch in April 1999, allowing full scale development to get underway, permitting service entry in late 2002. Program development cost is estimated at $US300m, and the list unit price $US36m. \r\n\r\nCompared with the A319, the A318 is 4.5 frames shorter, reducing standard two class seating from 124 to 107. The A318's other significant new feature will be its powerplant, the newly developed Pratt & Whitney PW-6000 (being developed in the 67-102kN/15-23,000lb thrust class), but the CFM International CFM56-5 is also available.

The first A319 airline order came from French carrier Air Inter (since merged into Air France), whose order for six was announced in February 1994. Since then Swissair, Air Canada, Lufthansa, Northwest, United, US Airways and British Airways are among the major customers that have ordered more than 500 A319s (all also operate or have on order A320s). \r\n\r\nThe A319 flew for the first time on August 25 1995 from Hamburg in Germany. European JAA certification and service entry, with Swissair, took place in April 1996. \r\n\r\nThe A319 is a minimum change, shortened derivative of the highly successful A320. The major difference between the A320 and A319 is that the latter is shorter by seven fuselage frames, while in almost all other respects the A319 and A320 are identical. \r\n\r\nLike the A321, A330 and A340, the A319 features Airbus' common two crew glass cockpit with sidestick controllers first introduced on the A320. There are significant crew training cost benefits and operational savings from this arrangement as the A319, A320 and A321 can all be flown by pilots with the same type rating, meaning that the same flightcrew pool can fly any of the three types. Further, the identical cockpit means reduced training times for crews converting to the larger A330 and A340. The A319 is said to have the longest range in this category of airliner. \r\n\r\nLike the A321, A319 final assembly takes place in Hamburg with DaimlerChrysler Aerospace Airbus. Final assembly of all other Airbus airliners, including the A320, takes place at Toulouse. \r\n\r\nThe A319 forms the basis for the new baby of the Airbus family, the A318 100 seater (described separately), and the Airbus A319 Corporate Jetliner (also described separately). \r\n\r\n"}, {"relatedLinks": "Airbus A319CJ", "capacity": "Flightcrew of two.

This means, according to Airbus, that the A319CJ can be easily converted to an airliner, thus increasing the aircraft's potential resale value. \r\n\r\nThe first A319CJ is powered by IAE V2500s but CFM56s are also available, while the A319's containerised cargo hold means that the CJ's auxiliary fuel tanks can be easily loaded and unloaded, giving operators flexibility to reconfigure the aircraft for varying payload/range requirements. Like the rest of the A320 single aisle family (plus the A330 and A340), the A319CJ shares Airbus' common advanced six screen EFIS flightdeck with sidestick controllers, plus fly-by-wire flight controls. \r\n\r\nAt mid 2002 Airbus had selected five cabin outfitters for the aircraft - among which Lufthansa Technik in Germany, Jet Aviation of Switzerland, and Air France Industries.

The 150 seat A320 is the foundation and best selling member of the family. \r\n\r\nThe A320 is perhaps best known as the first airliner to introduce a fly-by-wire flight control system - where control inputs from the pilot are transmitted to the flying surfaces by electronic signals rather than mechanical means. Apart from a small weight saving, the advantage of Airbus' fly-by-wire is that as it is computer controlled, an inbuilt flight envelope protection makes it virtually impossible to exceed certain flight parameters such as G limits and the aircraft's maximum and minimum operating speeds and angle of attack limits. \r\n\r\nAlso integral to the A320 is the advanced electronic flightdeck, with six fully integrated EFIS colour displays and innovative sidestick controllers rather than conventional control columns. The A320 also employs a relatively high percentage of composite materials compared to earlier designs. Two engines are offered, the CFM56 and IAE V2500. \r\n\r\nThe A320 program was launched in March 1982, first flight occurred on February 22 1987, while certification was awarded on February 26 1988. Launch customer Air France took delivery of its first A320 in March that year. The first V2500 engined A320 was delivered to Adria Airways in May 1989. \r\n\r\nThe initial production version was the A320-100, which was built in only small numbers before being replaced by the definitive A320-200 (certificated in November 1988) with increased max takeoff weight, greater range and winglets.

To overcome this Airbus launched the longer range, heavier A321-200 development in 1995 which has a full pax transcontinental US range.

This gives Airbus a true early model 747 replacement and near direct competitor to the 747-400, with similar range, but, Airbus claims, better operating economics (per seat). \r\n\r\nThe A340-500 meanwhile is stretched by only 3.19m (10ft 6in) compared with the A340-300, and so seats 313 in three classes, but it has a massive range of 15,740km (8500nm), which makes it the longest ranging airliner in the world, capable for example of operating Los Angeles-Singapore nonstop. \r\n\r\nThe two new A340 models share a common wing. The wing is based on the A330/A340's but is 1.6m (5.2ft) longer and has a tapered wingbox insert, increasing wing area and fuel capacity. Both models feature three fuselage plugs. The other change to the A340 airframe is the use of the A330-200 twin's larger fin and enlarged horizontal area stabilisers. To cope with the increased weights the centre undercarriage main gear is a four wheel bogie, rather than a two wheel unit. \r\n\r\nBoth new A340s have a high degree of commonality with the A330 and other A340 models. They feature Airbus' common two crew flightdeck, but with some improvements such as LCD rather than CRT displays and modernised systems. \r\n\r\nThe A340-500 is powered by four 236kN (53,000lb) thrust Rolls-Royce Trent 556 turbofans, and the A340-600 by the 249kN (56,000lb) thrust Trent 556. \r\n\r\nThe commercial launch for the A340-500/600 was at the 1997 Paris Airshow, the program's industrial launch was in December that year when Virgin Atlantic ordered eight A340-600s and optioned eight.

The A380 base model is the 555 seat A380-800 (launch customer Emirates). Potential future models include the 590 ton MTOW 10,410km (5620nm) A380-800F freighter, able to carry a 150 tonne payload, and the stretched, 656 seat, A380-900.\r\n\r\nAirbus first began studies on a very large 500 seat airliner in the early 1990s. The European manufacturer saw developing a competitor and successor to the Boeing 747 as a strategic play to end Boeing's dominance of the very large airliner market and round out Airbus' product line-up. \r\n\r\nAirbus began engineering development work on such an aircraft, then designated the A3XX, in June 1994. Airbus studied numerous design configurations for the A3XX and gave serious consideration to a single deck aircraft which would have seated 12 abreast and twin vertical tails. However Airbus settled upon a twin deck configuration, largely because of the significantly lighter structure required. \r\n\r\nKey design aims include the ability to use existing airport infrastructure with little modifications to the airports, and direct operating costs per seat 15-20% less than those for the 747-400. With 49% more floor space and only 35% more seating than the previous largest aircraft, Airbus is ensuring wider seats and aisles for more passenger comfort. Using the most advanced technologies, the A380 is also designed to have 10-15% more range, lower fuel burn and emissions, and produce less noise. \r\n\r\nThe A380 features an advanced version of the Airbus common two crew cockpit, with pull-out keyboards for the pilots, extensive use of composite materials such as GLARE (an aluminium/glass fibre composite), and four 302 to 374kN (68,000 to 84,000lb) class Rolls-Royce Trent 900 or Engine Alliance (General Electric/Pratt & Whitney) GP7200 turbofans now under development. \r\nOn July 24, 2000, Emirates became the first customer making a firm order commitment, followed by Air France, International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC), Singapore Airlines, Qantas and Virgin Atlantic. Together these companies completed the 50 orders needed to launch the programme. \r\n\r\nOn receipt of the required 50th launch order commitment, the Airbus A3XX was renamed A380 and officially launched on December 19, 2000. The out of sequence A380 designation was chosen as the \"8\" represents the cross-section of the twin decks. In early 2001 the general configuration design was frozen, and metal cutting for the first A380 component occurred on January 23, 2002, at Nantes in France. In 2002 more than 6000 people were working on A380 development. \r\n\r\nApart from the prime contractors in France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Spain, components for the A380 airframe are also manufactured by industrial partners in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Finland, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States. A380 final assembly is taking place in Toulouse, France, with interior fitment in Hamburg, Germany. Major A380 assemblies are transported to Toulouse by ship, barge and road. \r\n\r\nOn January 18, 2005, the first Airbus A380 was officially revealed in a lavish ceremony, attended by 5000 invited guests including the French, German, British and Spanish president and prime ministers, representing the countries that invested heavily in the 10-year, \u00e2\ufffd\u00ac10 billion+ ($13 billion+) aircraft program, and the CEOs of the 14 A380 customers, who had placed firm orders for 149 aircraft by then. \r\n\r\nLater, the following companies also ordered the A380: FedEx (the launch customer for the A380-800F freighter), Qatar Airways, Lufthansa, Korean Air, Malaysia Airlines, Etihad Airways, Thai Airways and UPS. \r\n\r\nHowever, in 2007, amid production delays, Airbus announced that it was halting design work on the A380 freighter to concentrate on the passenger version of the aircraft.  FedEx and UPS canceled their orders for the aircraft.\r\n\r\nFive prototypes were used in the flight test programme, which was heavily delayed due to problems with configuration management and wiring issues.

The Challengerbased Citabria first flew in May 1964 and incorporated a number of changes over the earlier models. These included more glass area, a squarer tail and stressing for limited (+5g, 2g) aerobatic flight, while other features were the flapless wing and choice of 75kW (100hp) Continental O200 or 80kW (108hp) Lycoming O235 engines. Variants on this theme were the 110kW (150hp) O320 powered 7GCAA and the 7GCBC with a longer span wing fitted with flaps.\r\n\r\nBellanca took over production of the Citabria in September 1970, renaming the 7ECA, which by now was powered by an 85kW (115hp) O235, as the Citabria; the 7GCAA the Citabria 150 and the 7GCBC the Citabria 150S.\r\n\r\nChampion initially developed the 7KCAB model, but Bellanca took this over, resulting in the fully aerobatic 8KCAB Decathlon. The ultimate Decathlon design was the 135kW (180hp) AEIO360 powered Super Decathlon.\r\n\r\nThe Scout was designed to perform a number of utility roles, and appeared in 1970. The updated 8GCBC followed in 1974 with a 135kW (180hp) O360.\r\n\r\nBellanca production ended in 1982, while the Champion Aircraft Company produced the range in limited numbers between 198586.\r\n\r\nAll three models are once again in low rate production, this time with American Champion. American Champion restarted production of the series in 1990, and now builds the baseline 7ECA Citabria Aurora (reintroduced in 1995), the 7GCBC Citabria Explorer, 8KCAB Super Decathlon and the 8GCBC Scout (and Scout CS with constant speed propeller).

The basic configuration of the An-225  is the same as the An-124, except the An-225 is longer, has no rear ramp/door assembly, and incorporates a 32-wheel landing gear system (two nose and fourteen main wheel bogies, seven per side, each with two wheels).\r\n\r\nAn-225 \"Mriya\" (\"Mriya\" is Ukrainian word for \"dream) is also capable to transport other oversized objects/cargo. It is not a military aircraft, but it could find many military uses, because of the ability to transport cargo that no other aircraft is capable to.\r\n\r\nThe plane had the first flight in early 1988 and entered service in 1989. It's first flight took 75 minutes. After the cancellation of the Buran space program, the only An-225 built was stored in spring 1994, and it's engines were used for An-124s. In 2001 the aircraft was made airworthy again, and made it's new first flight on May 7. There were rumors that the European Space Agency had plans to launch the unmanned British HoTOL (Horizontal Take-Off and Landing) from the An-225, though these rumors appear to be unfounded. Although, some possibilities for deployment have already been found. Plenty of customers are to be found in the USA. According to Bruce Bird, Director of the Charter Division of Air Foyle, parts of rocket launchers like the Delta and Atlas could be transported in the An-225. Lockheed's planned Venture Star could be transported on its back. Additionally the Mrija could serve as a launch platform for the X-34B. Furthermore big sections of aircraft could be transported in it. The complete assembled fuselage of a Boeing 737 can be fitted in the hold. \r\n\r\nA second An-225 was partly built, but was stored before it was finished.

Aeroflot was the largest An-24 operator, with others going to Soviet client nations. \r\n\r\nSubsequent production versions of the An-24 were the An-24B and the An-24T freighter. A small turbojet in the right engine nacelle to boost takeoff performance resulted in the An-24RT and An-24RV. The An-24P firebomber was also developed before Ukrainian production ceased in 1978. \r\n\r\nThe An-24 was also developed into the An-26 \"Curl\" military tactical transport with more powerful engines and redesigned tail, which itself evolved into the An-32 with enhancements for better hot and high performance. Over 550 An-26s are in civil service. \r\n\r\nThe An-30 development has been produced in limited numbers and is used largely for aerial survey and cartography work.

The An-32 features above wing mounted engines to give the larger diameter props adequate ground clearance. \r\n\r\nChina's Xian Aircraft Manufacturing Company is now the sole production source for the An-24 as the Y-7. The Y-7-100 incorporates a number of modifications including a revised passenger interior and flightdeck, and wingtip winglets.

At the 1991 Paris Air Show a model was shown and details were made public for the first time. The aircraft is intended to replace An-24s, Let L-410s and Yak-40s. \r\n\r\nAs the An-28 was produced in Poland, and had to be paid in foreign currency after the break-up of the Soviet Union, payment in local currency was an added advantage for the development of the An-38.\r\n\r\nThe An-38 retains the basic wing and twin fin tail structure of the An-28, but has a stretched fuselage with three additional seat rows. New high efficiency Honeywell TPE331 or Omsk TVD-20 engines power the An-28. Many other improvements have been made such as improved sound and vibration insulation, reduced external noise, improved cockpit and passenger cabin comfort, payload, fuel efficiency and flight speed. The An-38 is equipped with a rear cargo door and a cargo-handling overhead-track hoist. The seats and the baggage compartment can be folded by the crew to provide a clear space for use as a cargo aircraft.\r\n\r\nThe fixed tricycle gear with low pressure tires enables operation from unpaved runways. The An-38 has weather radar and an integrated navigation system and can be operated by night and in adverse weather. It can be equipped with Western or CIS avionics.\r\n\r\nApart from passenger and cargo configuration, the multirole An-38 can also be equipped for forest patrol, aerial photography, survey, fishery patrol, ambulance, VIP transport and military airlift. \r\n\r\nThe first flight was made on June 23 1994 by the version with TPE331 engines, the An-38-100. The TVD-20 version, the An-38-200, followed on December 11 2001. Certification of the An-38-100 in compliance with AP-25 rules was granted April 22 1997. The An-38-200 was certificated on November 28 2002.\r\n\r\nThe An-38-110 is a -100 with a reduced avionics fit, the An-38-120 is a -100 with an enhanced avionics fit.\r\n\r\nIn December 1995 Antonov and NAPO (Novosibirsk Aircraft Production Association) established a joint venture company, Siberian Antonov Aircraft, to produce, market and provide after-sale support of the An-38. Series production of the An-38-100 aircraft is by NAPO.\r\n\r\nTwo prototypes (one at Antonov and one at NAPO) and a static test airframe were built. Vostok Airlines became the launch customer for the production aircraft and the first three were received by mid-1995.

The next to appear was the two seat side by side J/2 Arrow family, with a 56kW (75hp) Continental, and was further developed into the J/4 Archer, which replaced the Continental with a Cirrus Minor engine. The J/1N Alpha was an attempt to increase sales and overcome the problems associated with fitting the Cirrus Minor engine to the J/1 with less equipment and minor improvements. \r\n\r\nMost Auster J/5 models were four seaters except for the initial J/5 which was an Autocrat with a more powerful engine, while the J/5B incorporated the enlarged four seat cabin. The J/5F Aiglet trainer was a fully aerobatic two seat trainer.

Production deliveries followed shortly afterwards. \r\n\r\nDesign features of the Husky include a braced high wing, seating for two in tandem and dual controls. This high wing arrangement was selected for good all round visibility, essential for the many observation and patrol roles the Husky is suited for. Power is supplied by a relatively powerful, for the Husky's weight, 135kW (180hp) Textron Lycoming O360 flat four turning a constant speed prop.

A range of (conventional construction) Pups was planned, from a 75kW (100hp) two seat trainer through to retractable undercarriage four seaters, a light twin and a fully aerobatic 155kW (210hp) military trainer, the Bull Pup. All would have featured metal construction. \r\n\r\nThe Pup made its first flight on April 8 1967 and deliveries of the initial Pup 100 began a year later in April 1968. The Pup is one of the few light aircraft to feature control sticks and not control columns. \r\n\r\nIn the meantime Beagle had flown the first of the more powerful Pup 150s in October 1967. The 150 featured a 110kW (150hp) engine, as the designation reflects, and seating for an extra adult. \r\n\r\nAnother more powerful variant originally designed in response to an Iranian Civil Air Training Organisation requirement was the Pup 160. The Pup 160 featured a 120kW (160hp) IO-320 Lycoming, but only nine were built. \r\n\r\nContinuing financial difficulties finally forced Beagle to close its doors in January 1970 after building 152 Pups, despite holding orders for an additional 276. As a result plans for the extended Pup based family came to nought. A further 21 near complete were subsequently assembled. \r\n\r\nThe B-125 Bulldog military basic trainer development first flew in May 1969. Scottish Aviation (which took over the design following Beagle's collapse) built 328 150kW (200hp) Lycoming IO-360 powered Bulldogs for a number of air forces, including Britain's Royal Air Force. Scottish Aviation became part of British Aerospace in the late 1970s.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}, {"relatedLinks": "Beagle B-206", "capacity": "Eight comprising one or two pilots plus six passengers behind them.", "dimensions": "Wing span 13.96m (45ft 10in), length 10.26m (33ft 8in), height 3.43m (11ft 4in).

The prototype of the new twin engine design, known as the B.206X, made its first flight on August 15 1961. A five/six seater powered by two 195kW (260hp) Continental IO470 engines, it was considered too small by its creators, and the design grew into the B.206Y with 230kW (310hp) Continental GIO470 engines, greater wing span, a larger cabin with increased seating capacity, greater fuel capacity and increased weights. \r\n\r\nThis allowed it to meet a Royal Air Force requirement for a communications aircraft capable of transporting a Vbomber support crew. Twenty were ordered for this role in place of the originally planned buy of 80, selected in preference to the de Havilland Dove. In RAF service the B.206 was designated the CC.1 Basset. Basset deliveries began in May 1965. \r\n\r\nFollowing the B.206Y were two evaluation B.206Z aircraft, then the initial civil production version, the Series 1 B.206C. Poor hot and high performance was in part responsible for slow sales and so Beagle designed the Series 2 B.206S with more powerful turbocharged GTSIO520 engines. The B.206S also introduced a slightly revised cabin to seat eight with the entry door repositioned from above the wing to the rear port side fuselage. \r\n\r\nA commuter airliner development was also built in prototype form, the 10 seat Series 3 which a featured a further enlarged cabin.

This first model combined the wings, undercarriage, Lycoming engines and tail surfaces of the Model E50 Twin Bonanza with a new and substantially larger fuselage. A Queen Air 65 established a new class altitude record of 34,882ft in 1960. \r\n\r\nMany variants subsequently followed, including the 3630kg (8000lb) max takeoff weight Model 80 with more powerful 285kW (380hp) engines and swept fin and rudder. This model evolved into the A80, the first to be offered as a commuter airliner. Introduced in 1964, the A80 had a redesigned nose and interior, increased wing span and a 227kg (500lb) greater takeoff weight. The pressurised 88 had round windows and the longer wingspan of the A80 and a 3992kg (8800lb) MTOW. \r\n\r\nThe Model B80 was the last major production model and appeared in 1966. It featured the longer span wing and the 88's MTOW. The model A65 was essentially a Model 65 with the swept fin and rudder of the Model 80, and entered production in 1967. The Model 70 entered production in 1969, it featured the longer span wings, 3720kg (8200lb) MTOW and 255kW (340hp) engines.

However a further 30 months of development work passed before the first production Model 76 took to the air on May 24 1977. Certification was granted in early 1978, with first deliveries commencing in that May.\r\n\r\nThe Duchess was positioned between the Bonanza and the Baron in the Beechcraft model range. Beech developed it for its Beech Aero Centers, and pitched it at the personal use light twin, light charter and multi engine training markets. Design aims included good low speed and single engine handling.\r\n\r\nAside from the prototype PD-289, no variations of the Duchess 76 were built before production ended in 1982. All Duchesses therefore feature two Lycoming O-360 engines (with counter rotating propellers), a T-tail (incorporated to reduce control forces and improve elevator response), entry doors on either side of the cabin and electric trim and flap controls (the prototype PD-289 featured manually operated flaps). The fuselage was based loosely on the single engine Sierra's, and like the Sierra and its Musketeer predecessors featured a bonded honeycomb construction wing. The Sierra and Duchess also share common structural components.\r\n\r\nBeech offered three factory option packages on the Duchess - the Weekender, Holiday and Professional - and 11 factory installed avionics packages.\r\n\r\nBeech developed the Duchess for low cost, high volume production, but the falling popularity of light twins, an economic recession and crippling product liability laws in the USA all contributed to a relatively short production run which wound up in 1982. Sales had peaked in 1979 when 213 were built. \r\n\r\nLike its contemporaries the Grumman/Gulfstream American Cougar and Piper Seminole, the Duchess' success was hampered through unfortunate timing. Ever increasing advances in engine efficiency, safety and reliability led to a rise in popularity for big high performance singles such as Beech's own Bonanza series, which lacked the maintenance overheads of two engines, but had comparable performance. However, to a greater extent than the Seminole and Cougar, the Duchess enjoyed some success as a twin engine pilot trainer, a role in which it is widely used for today.\r\n\r\n"}, {"relatedLinks": "Beech 77 Skipper", "capacity": "Two seated side by side.", "dimensions": "Wing span 9.14m (30ft 0in), length 7.32m (24ft 0in), height 2.41m (7ft 11in).

A PD-285 prototype first flew on February 6 1975, but this differed from production aircraft in that it was powered by a 75kW (100hp) Continental O-200 engine and featured a conventional low set tailplane. \r\n\r\nProtracted development meant that the first of the definitive Model 77 Skippers did not fly until September 1978, by which time the 85kW (115hp) Lycoming O-235 engine and T-tail had been settled upon. In the Beech product line-up the Skipper was to replace the two seat Model 19 Sport variant of the Musketeer family, production of which ended in 1978. \r\n\r\nUS FAA certification for the Skipper was awarded in April 1979, and the first production aircraft were delivered in May 1979 to Beechcraft's own Beech Aero Center pilot training centres.\r\n\r\nProduction lasted just three years until mid 1981 (at the time Beech said the halt in production was a \"suspension\" pending an improvement in market conditions). During that time little more than 300 Skippers had been built (at a rate of about 10 per month). Unsold Skipper stocks kept the type available for a further year. \r\n\r\nThe Skipper was in direct competition with Piper's very successful PA-38 Tomahawk and Cessna's 152. The Tomahawk was developed in a very similar time scale to the Skipper (entering service in early 1978) and both aircraft share a T-tail, low wing and canopy style cabin configuration (with 360\u00b0 all round vision and a door on each side), and the Lycoming O-235 powerplant. Of the three the Skipper was the least successful, being comfortably outsold by the Cessna and Piper products. \r\n\r\nOther features of the Skipper design are a NASA developed GA(W)1 high lift wing (the result of joint NASA and Beech research into high lift, supercritical aerofoils), bonded metal construction, tubular spars, and flap and aileron actuation by torque tubes rather than the more conventional cable and pulley system. New construction techniques were intended to reduce manufacturing costs. \r\n\r\n"}, {"relatedLinks": "Beech 99 Airliner", "capacity": "Flightcrew of one or two.

The 204 was something of a quantum leap forward in helicopter design as it was one of the first to be powered by a turboshaft. The turboshaft engine radically improved the practicality of the helicopter because of its lower maintenance and operating costs, lower fuel consumption, light weight and high power to weight ratio. The use of a turboshaft in the 204 allowed it to carry a useful payload over respectable ranges and at reasonable speeds, which resulted in the 204 and 205 becoming the most successful western helicopter series in terms of numbers built. \r\n\r\nThe UH1B, from which the 204B was derived, was first delivered March 1961.

Development of the Model 212 was a joint venture between Bell, Pratt & Whitney Canada and the Canadian government, the latter providing financial support. The resulting helicopter (designated CUH1N in Canadian and UH1N in US military service) first flew in 1969 and was granted commercial certification in October 1970. The first Canadian CUH1Ns were handed over in May 1971. \r\n\r\nThe most significant feature of the Twin TwoTwelve is the PT6T Twin-Pac engine installation. This consists of two PT6 turboshafts mounted side by side and driving a single output shaft via a combining gearbox. The most obvious benefit of the new arrangement is better performance due to the unit's increased power output. However, the Twin-Pac engine system has a major advantage in that should one engine fail, sensors in the gearbox instruct the remaining operating engine to develop full power, thus providing a true engine out capability, even at max takeoff weight. \r\n\r\nAside from the twin engines, the 212 features only minor detail changes over the earlier Model 205 and UH1H, including a slightly reprofiled nose. The 212 is also offered with a choice of IFR or VFR avionics suites.

Bell based its proposal on the 214 but made substantial design changes, resulting in what is essentially an all new helicopter with little commonality with the smaller 214 series. \r\n\r\nThe 214ST features two General Electric CT7 turboshafts (the commercial equivalent of the military T700), a stretched fuselage seating up to 17 in the main cabin, glassfibre main rotor blades, and lubrication free elastomeric bearings in the main rotor hub. The ST suffix originally stood for Stretched Twin, reflecting the changes over the 214, but this was later changed to stand for Super Transporter. \r\n\r\nThe 214ST was to have been built under licence in Iran as part of that country's plans to establish a large army air wing (other aircraft ordered in large numbers under this plan were the 214A Isfahan and AH1J SeaCobra), but the Islamic revolution and fall of the Shah in 1979 put paid to these plans. \r\n\r\nUndeterred, Bell continued development of the 214ST - which first flew in February 1977 - for civil and military customers.

However, Bell concluded that the 407T would not offer sufficient payload/range performance, and so began studies of a new light twin. \r\n\r\nThe result was the all new 427, which Bell announced at the Heli Expo in Dallas in February 1996. Prior to this announcement Bell had signed a collaborative partnership agreement with South Korea's Samsung Aerospace Industries covering the 427. Samsung's role on the 427 program is significant, the South Korean company builds the 427's fuselage and tailboom, and may later assemble any 427s sold in South Korea and China at its Sachon plant. (Samsung also builds the left and right fuselage halves and the tailboom for the Bell 212 and 412). Bell builds the 427's flight dynamics systems at Fort Worth in Texas, with final assembly at Bell's Mirabel, Quebec plant. \r\n\r\nThe 427 was the first Bell designed entirely on computer (including using CATIA 3D modelling). Compared to the 407 the 427's cabin is 33cm (13in) longer, is largely of composite construction amd lacks the roof beam which obstructs the cabin on the 206/206L/407. \r\n\r\nPower is from two FADEC equipped Pratt & Whitney Canada PW-206 turboshafts, driving the composite four blade main rotor and two blade tail rotor (based on those on the OH-58D Kiowa and Bell 407) through a new combining gearbox. The main rotor's soft-in-plane hub features a composite flexbeam yoke and elastomeric joints, eliminating the need for lubrication and any form of maintenance.

In conjunction with Boeing it is building the military V-22 Osprey - the first production Ospreys are due to be delivered to the US Marines in 1999. \r\n\r\nIn late 1996 Bell and Boeing announced that they intended to use their expertise and experience with the V22 to develop a nine seat civil tiltrotor. The Bell Boeing 609 was formally unveiled on November 18 1996. However in early 1998 Boeing announced its withdrawal from the program as a risk sharing partner to remain as a major subcontractor. Then in September that year Bell announced that Agusta would become a risk sharing development partner in the redesignated BA 609. Agusta will participate in BA 609 development, manufacture components and assemble BA 609s for European and other markets. \r\n\r\nFirst flight for the BA 609 is planned for mid 1999 with certification and first deliveries scheduled for April 2002. (The US FAA is drawing up a new certification category for tiltrotors and a new pilot type rating.) \r\n\r\nThe benefits of a tiltrotor are that it has the vertical takeoff, landing and hovering abilities of a helicopter combined with fixed wing turboprop speed and performance. As such Bell anticipates that the 609 will compete against helicopters such as the Sikorsky S76 and turboprops such as Beech's King Air. As well as point to point corporate transport Bell envisages that the 609 will be used for offshore oil rig support, search and rescue and medevac missions, where its unique capabilities would be particularly useful. \r\n\r\nThe 609 will incorporate advanced technologies such as a glass cockpit, flybywire flight controls and a composite construction fuselage. Power will be from two PT6C67A turboprops. \r\n\r\nThe 609 could form the basis for a family of civil tiltrotors. \r\n\r\n"}, {"relatedLinks": "Beriev Be-200", "capacity": "Flightcrew of two.

These engines were replaced by 723kW (970shp) TVD-10 turboprops, with which the first flight was made on July 13 the same year. The prototype was displayed statically at the Domodedovo air show in July 1967. Two other prototypes were also built. The Be-30 had accomodation for 14 passengers. The aircraft was further developed into the Be-32, which had higher powered TVD-10B engines, and accomodation for up to 17 passengers. It is reported that eight production aircraft were manufactured, between 1968 and 1976, three at the experimental factory No.49, and five at the Taganrog factory No.86. It is thought however that the first three are the prototype Be-30s, and the next five the (pre)production Be-32s. The airplane was thoroughly tested in many different regions in Russia under various operating conditions. In the mid seventies Beriev used the Be-32 to claim two time-to-height records (3000m in 2min 24.8sec, 6000m in 5min 18sec). NATO assigned the code name Cuff to the Be-30/32.  \r\n\r\nThe Be-30 had to compete with the Antonov An-28 (first flight September 1969) for the large Aeroflot orders that were to be expected. The Be-30 had a longer range, was faster, and had better crosswind handling. The An-28 had better landing and take-off performance and a larger capacity. Therefore both aircraft were recommended for production. But the whole project was cancelled about 1972 when Aeroflot chose the Czech Let L-410 Turbolet (described separately) in preference to Beriev's (and Antonov's) design. The L-410 had a slightly larger load capacity, but was mainly chosen for political reasons, strengthening the economical ties with the East European countries. Since then the Be-30/32 lay dormant until Beriev resurrected it in the early 1990s in a bid to attract new business. As Czech and other foreign aircraft and spare parts had now to be paid in hard currency, it was thought that domestic aircraft could be preferred for the internal Russian market, and could gain hard currency when exported. \r\n\r\nBeriev exhibited the Be-32 at the 1993 Paris and Dubai air shows, the design bureau claiming that the Be-32 incorporated a number of improvements, including more powerful engines. This demonstrator was one of the original aircraft built in the early seventies. This Be-32 was painted in the colors of Moscow Airways, who had placed an order for 50 earlier in 1993, but this company ceased operations before any were delivered.\r\n\r\nTechnical features of this high wing unpressurised commuter include a fuselage of all-metal semi-monocoque structure covered mainly with large chemically-milled panels attached by bonding and spot-welding. The cantilever wing has anhedral on the outer panels. The spars of the main torsion box and the skin panels are made of mechanically and chemically-milled profile pressings. The detachable leading edge is of bonded construction. Thin 3-layer honeycomb panels stiffened by stringers are used for about half of the wing skin. Bonding and spot-welding is used for most of the joints. Double-slotted flaps occupy the trailing edge inboard of the ailerons.\r\nThe tail unit has a similar all-metal cantilever structure with a thin honeycomb skin covering. For weight saving, glass fibre reinforced plastics are used for some non-load-carrying parts, such as the wingtips, some tail surfaces, and wing/fuselage fillets.\r\n\r\nA hot-air de-icing system using engine-bleed air is provided for the wings, tail unit, and engine air intakes, while the windscreen and propellers have electric de-icing. The aircraft has a retractable tricycle landing gear with a single wheel with a low pressure tire on each unit. The main units retract rearward into the engine nacelles. The nosewheel retracts forward and is steerable. Floats and skis are optional. There is provision for an interconnecting shaft between the engines that permits power on both propellers during an engine-out condition. This system was installed and flight tested on the second prototype. There are four integral fuel tanks, located in the wing torsion box.\r\n\r\nThe Be-30 has accomodation for a crew of two on the flight deck and 14 passengers in the cabin, later increased to 17 in the Be-32. There are two small compartments, for mail and small freight, on the port side between the flight deck and the cabin. On the starboard side, aft of the cabin, is a carry-on baggage compartment, and a toilet is provided at the rear of the cabin. The aircraft carries its own folding stairway.\r\n\r\nOn August 15, 1995, a prototype was flown of the Pratt & Whitney PT6A-65B powered Be-32K, a conversion of the Be-32 exhibited at Paris and Dubai in 1993. Production aircraft will be powered by the Russian built version of this successful engine, the Klimov PK6A-65B.\r\n\r\nIn September 1996 it was announced that the Be-32 would be produced by IAR in Romania, but these plans were later denied. In 1998 it was stated that the Be-32K would be built by Taganrog Aviation, but flight testing was reportedly still under way in 1999. Apparently there has not been much progress in recent years, and as far as is known, no new aircraft have been built since the mid seventies. \r\n\r\n"}, {"relatedLinks": "Boeing 707", "capacity": "Flightcrew of three or four. \r\n707-120 max seating for 179, or 110 in two classes (44 first and 66 economy).\r\n707-320B - Max seating for 219, or 189 single class at 81cm (32in) pitch, or 147 in two classes. \r\nConvertible or freighter versions - 13 A type containers.", "dimensions": "707-120B - Wing span 39.90m (130ft 10in), length 44.07m (144ft 6in), height 12.94m (42ft 5in).

The 707 also laid the foundations for Boeing's dominance of the jet airliner market. \r\n\r\nRecognising the jet engine's potential for commercial aviation, Boeing (at great financial risk) decided to develop a jet powered transport that could fulfil military tanker transport roles but be easily adapted to become an airliner.  The resulting prototype, known as the 367 Dash 80, flew for the first time on July 16 1954. Impressed, the US Air Force ordered a larger version, with a wider fuselage (12 ft, vs 11 ft for the Dash 80) into production as the KC-135 tanker/transport (more than 800 were built).  At first, Boeing wanted to sell the same size aircraft to the airlines, but the airlines insisted on an even larger airplane, which Douglas promised to build (this became the DC-8).  Boeing finally relented, designing the 707 as a longer aircraft with a slightly wider fuselage (12 ft 4 in).\r\n\r\nThe first production 707 (a 707-120 for Pan Am) flew on December 20 1957, and entered service later the following year. Developments of the 707-120 include the similar 707-220, the shorter 138 for Qantas, and the stretched 707-320, which flew in July 1959. The 707-120 and 320 were later reengined with JT3D turbofans (in place of the original JT3 and JT4 turbojets) to become the 707-120B, and the 707-320B respectively. The 707-320C was a convertible model, the 707-420 was powered by RollsRoyce Conways, while the proposed CFM-56 powered 707-700 upgrade was flight tested in the late 1970s but never entered production. \r\n\r\nMost civil 707s in service today have been converted to freighters, while a number are used as corporate transports. \r\n\r\nMany air forces have bought 707s, new or converted second-hand aircraft, for general transport, aerial refuelling, and electronic warfare. The E-3 Sentry is a dedicated airborne warning and control system (AWACS) platform with a large rotodome above the fuselage. The E-6 Mercury performs the TACAMO (Take Charge and Move Out) role with the US Navy, maintaining communication with the ballistic missile submarines. The E-8 J-Stars (Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System) performs the battlefield control role.

Other changes were made to the wing which introduced full span leading edge flaps, while a glove between the inner engines and the fuselage increased wing sweep and wing area and decreased the wing's thickness/chord ratio. The changes to the wing made it more aerodynamically efficient, permitting higher cruising speeds and lowered minimum speeds (which aided field performance). \r\n\r\nLike the early 707s the first 720s had JT3C turbojets, although less powerful models lacking water injection because of the 720's lighter weight. Compared with the 707-120 the 720 also had reduced fuel capacity and a lower max takeoff weight.

The 720B also featured a higher maximum zero fuel weight (significantly boosting payload/range) and an increased max takeoff weight due to the heavier turbofan engines. \r\n\r\nMajor 720 operators included American Airlines (a number of its 720s were converted to 720Bs with turbofan engines), United, Continental, Eastern, Northwest Orient and Western, while operators outside the US included Lufthansa and Avianca. \r\n\r\nToday (early 2002) three 720s are believed to be in use as corporate transports, and two are used by Pratt & Whitney as engine testbeds. \r\n\r\n"}, {"relatedLinks": "Boeing 727-100", "capacity": "Flightcrew of three (two pilots and flight engineer).

Boeing persisted however and serious development of the 727 beginning in June 1959. The program was launched on the strength of orders for 80 from Eastern and United in 1960. \r\n\r\nThe resulting Boeing Model 727 pioneered the rear trijet configuration, with power from three specially designed Pratt & Whitney JT8D turbofans (although RollsRoyce Speys were originally considered). The trijet design was settled upon as it gave the redundancy of three engines, better climb performance than a twin and improved operating economics over a four engine jet. The 727 also introduced an advanced wing design with the first airliner application of triple slotted Krueger flaps. The 727 retained the 707's fuselage cross section, but with a redesigned smaller lower fuselage due to the need to carry less baggage on shorter range flights, and it has limited parts commonality with the 707 and 720. The 727 was also the first Boeing airliner to feature an APU (auxiliary power unit). \r\n\r\nThe prototype 727 first flew on February 9 1963, with certification granted in December that year. The first 727 entered service with Eastern Airlines on February 9 the following year. \r\n\r\nDevelopment of the initial 727-100 resulted in a small family of sub variants, including higher gross weight options for the basic passenger carrying 727, the 727-100C Convertible and 727-200QC Quick Change, both with a large freight door on the forward left hand side of the fuselage.

The 727-200 was essentially a minimum change development of the 100, the only major change being the 6.10m (20ft) fuselage stretch, which increased maximum seating to 189 passengers. The 727-200's stretch consisted of two 3.05m (10ft) plugs, one forward and one rear of the wing. Otherwise the 727-100 and 200 shared common engines, fuel tank capacity and the same maximum takeoff weight. \r\n\r\nThe first flight of the 727-200 occurred on July 27 1967, with certification granted in late November that year. The -200 was placed into service by launch customer Northeast Airlines (this airline was later acquired by Delta) the following month, by which time total 727 orders for both models had exceeded 500. \r\n\r\nThe 727-200 helped broaden the sales appeal of the 727 considerably and snared significant sales. However the 200 was restricted by its relatively short range, due to it having the same fuel capacity as the 727-100, so Boeing developed the increased range Advanced 727-200. First flown in March 1972 changes introduced on the Advanced model included increased fuel capacity, and thus range, the option of more powerful engines, quieter engine nacelles and strengthened structure. The Advanced remained the primary 727-200 production model until production ceased in 1984. \r\n\r\nThe 727-200 remains popular with passengers and pilots but it does not meet Stage 3 noise requirements. To overcome this a number of hushkit programs are on offer while Valsan converted 23 727s to its Stage 3 compliant Quiet 727 standard (before the company collapsed). This retrofit included installing JT8D-217s on the outer pylons and acoustic treatment of the centre engine.

Boeing was able to draw upon design experience with the USAF transport and launched the new airliner on July 25 1966. First flight occurred on February 9 1969, certification was awarded on December 30 that year. \r\n\r\nThe basic 747-100 entered service with Pan American in January 1970. Progressive development of the 747 led to the 747-200B with higher weights, more powerful engines and longer range. The -200B first flew in October 1970 entering service with KLM, while nine higher weight 747-100Bs were built. \r\n\r\nDevelopments include the 747-200F freighter, the SR (short range) optimised for high cycle short sector operations and the C (Combi). \r\n\r\nThe 747 holds a place in the public eye unlike any other aircraft. The so called `Queen of the Skies' opened up international travel to millions.

Ideas studied included fuselage plugs fore and aft of the wing increasing seating to around 600, or running the upper deck down the entire length of the fuselage. In the end Boeing launched the more modest 747SUD (Stretched Upper Deck) with greater upper deck seating on June 12 1980. \r\n\r\nThe 747SUD designation was soon changed to 747EUD (for Extended Upper Deck), and then 747-300.

The lengthened upper deck introduced two new emergency exit doors and allows an optional flightcrew rest area immediately aft of the flightdeck to be fitted.

The -400ER has the same size as the -400, but has more range or payload capability. The MTOW was increased by 15,870kg (35,000lb) to 412,770kg (910,000lb), giving a further range of 805km (435nm) or a 6800kg (15,000lb) greater payload. The -400ER also features a wholly new cabin interior with larger luggage bins, and several flight deck improvements.\r\n\r\nThe -400ER incorporates the strengthened wing, body, and landing gear of the -400F, plus an auxiliary fuel tank in the forward cargo hold, and an optional second one. Operators who don't need these can remove them both, gaining additional cargo volume.\r\n\r\nThe first 747-400ER was rolled out in June 2002, and flew for the first time on July 31, 2002, and this was the 1308th 747 to fly. \r\n\r\nA cargo version, the 747-400ERF, followed the standard -400ER, and was launched April 30, 2001 on an order by leasing company ILFC for 5. The first -400ERF is the 1315th 747 built. The -ERF has the same MTOW as the -ER, and this will give an extra range of 970km (525nm), or an extra payload of 9980kg (22,000lb) at MTOW compared with the standard -400F.     \r\n\r\nShortly before delivery of the first -400ER, Boeing had received orders for 15 ER/ERFs from 5 customers.\r\n\r\nVarious growth 747 models have been studied.

The 747SP is the only 747 model to feature a changed fuselage length compared with the 747-100.\r\n\r\nThe 747SP first flew on July 4 1975, certification was awarded on February 4 1976 and first delivery (to Pan American) was in March 1976. \r\n\r\nThe 747SP's fuselage is shortened by 14.35m (47ft 1in) compared to other 747 models, while the vertical tail was increased in height to compensate for the reduced moment arm with the shorter fuselage. Structurally the 747SP was lightened in some areas because of the significant reduction in gross weights. Overall though the 747SP retained 90% commonality of components with the 747-100 and 200. While shortening the 747's fuselage increased the fuel fraction and thus range, it also meant that seating capacity was reduced.  \r\n\r\nThe SP suffix in 747SP stands for Special Performance, and points to the ultra long range abilities of this 747 variant that preceded the later 747-400 by 15 years. The 747SP's range is best illustrated by the spate of long range distance records it set in the mid 1970s. The most prominent of those was the delivery flight of a South African Airways SP, which over March 23/24 1976 flew nonstop with 50 passengers from Paine Field in Washington State to Cape Town, South Africa, a distance of 16,560km (8940nm). This world nonstop record for a commercial aircraft stood until 1989 when a Qantas 747-400 flew 17,945km (9688mn) nonstop from London to Sydney. \r\n\r\nSales of the 747SP were modest despite the increased range, as the SP had poorer operating economics per seat compared to the 747-200. However the 747SP did pioneer a number of long range nonstop services that are now commonly flown by the 747-400. \r\n\r\nNotable SP customers included South African Airways (who found the SP's extended range a great asset in bypassing African nations that denied it landing rights while South Africa's apartheid policies were in place), Qantas and PanAm, the latter pioneering nonstop trans Pacific Los Angeles/Sydney services.\r\n\r\nIn early 2005 less than twenty SPs remain in airline or corporate service. \r\n\r\n"}, {"relatedLinks": "Boeing 757-200", "capacity": "Flightcrew of two. 757-200 - Typical passenger arrangements vary from 178 two class (16 first & 162 economy), or 202 (12 first & 190 economy) or 208 (12 first and 196 economy) or 214 to 239 in all economy class. 757-200PF - Maximum of 15 standard 2.24 x 2.74m (88 x 108in) freight pallets on main deck.", "dimensions": "Wing span 38.05m (124ft 10in), length 47.32m (155ft 3in), height 13.56m (44ft 6in).

It was not until later in that decade however that Boeing settled on a more conventional design featuring the same cross section as the 727 (not to mention the 737, 707 and 720) but with the fuselage considerably longer in length, an all new wing, nose and flightdeck and fuel efficient high bypass turbofan engines. \r\n\r\nBoeing launched development of the 757 in March 1979 following orders from British Airways and Eastern. Developed in tandem with the larger widebody 767 the two types share a number of systems and technologies, including a common early generation EFIS flightdeck. \r\n\r\nFirst flight was on February 19 1982 and the 757 entered service in January the following year. Subsequent versions to appear are the 757-200PF Package Freighter, a pure freighter, and the 757-200M Combi (only one has been built). The standard passenger aircraft is designated the 757-200, there being no -100. The stretched 757-300 is described separately. \r\n\r\nInitial sales of the 757 were fairly slow, however orders picked up significantly in the mid to late 1980s as traffic on routes previously served by smaller 727s and 737s grew to require the 757's extra capacity. Today 757 sales comfortably exceed those of the 767, a position that was reversed until the late 1980s. \r\n\r\n"}, {"relatedLinks": "Boeing 757-300", "capacity": "Flightcrew of two.

This new 757 stretch was covered by the 757-300X designation until its launch at the Farnborough Airshow in England in September 1996. \r\n\r\nThe most obvious change over the 757-200 is the 300's 54.43m (178ft 7in) long fuselage, which is 7.11m (23ft 4in) longer than the standard aircraft (and only fractionally shorter than the 767-300). This fuselage stretch allows a 20% increase in seating to 225 to 279 passengers, depending on the interior configuration. Lower hold freight capacity is also increased by 40% over the 757-200 by virtue of the longer fuselage. \r\n\r\nAnother feature of the 757-300 is its new interior which is based on that developed for the Next Generation 737 models. Features include a new sculptured ceiling, larger overhead bins, indirect overhead lighting and vacuum toilets. \r\n\r\nThe 757-300 shares the 200's cockpit, wing, tail and powerplant options, although the 300 will feature strengthened structure and landing gear to cope with the increased weights, new wheels, tyres and brakes and a tailskid. \r\n\r\nThe 757-300 first flew on August 2 1998, with certification in January 1999, and entry into service (with launch customer Condor - the charter arm of German flag carrier Lufthansa) in March 1999. The -300's 27 month development program from final configuration to planned first delivery is the fastest for any Boeing airliner (the 777-300 took 31 months for example).

At the time Boeing suffered from a shortage of engineering talent with a number of other key programs underway while Douglas had surplus engineering capacity following the cancellation of the MD-XX (Boeing and McDonnell Douglas subsequently merged in August 1997). The program was formally launched as the 767-400ER in January 1997 when Delta Airlines ordered 21. \r\n\r\nThe most significant change with the 767-300 is the 6.4m (21ft) fuselage stretch, which increases typical three class seating capacity from 218 to 245. Because of the increased fuselage length the -400 features all new, 46cm (18in) taller landing gear to restore rotation angles for acceptable takeoff and landing speeds and distances which would otherwise have been adversely affected by the fuselage stretch. The wheels, tyres and brakes are common with the 777. \r\n\r\nCompared to the 767-300, the 767-400ER's wing features 2.34m (7ft 8in) long raked wingtips which improve aerodynamic efficiency.

", "history": "Boeing's advanced widebody 777 twin incorporates more advanced technologies than any other previous Boeing airliner, and has been progressively developed into increasingly longer range developments. \r\n\r\nThe 777 was originally conceived as a stretched 767, but Boeing instead adopted an all new design. Notable 777 design features include a unique fuselage cross section, Boeing's first application of fly-by-wire, an advanced technology glass flightdeck with five liquid crystal displays, comparatively large scale use of composites (10% by weight), and advanced and extremely powerful engines. The 777 was also offered with optional folding wings where the outer 6m/21ft of each would fold upwards for operations at space restricted airports. \r\n\r\nThe basic 777-200 as launched in October 1990 was offered in two versions, the basic 777-200 (initially A-Market) and the increased weight longer range 777-200IGW (Increased Gross Weight, initially B-Market). The IGW has since been redesignated 777-200ER. \r\n\r\nThe 777-200 first flew on June 12 1994, with FAA and JAA certification awarded on April 19 1995. The FAA awarded full 180 minutes ETOPS clearance for PW4074 -200s on May 30 that year. First customer delivery was to United Airlines in May 1995. The first 777-200IGW/ER was delivered to British Airways in February 1997. \r\n\r\nThe 777-100X was a proposed shortened ultra long range (16,000km/8635nm) model, dropped in favour of the 777-200LR (originally 777-200X) design study. Boeing claims the 777-200LR will be the longest ranging airliner, capable of flying 16,417km (8865nm) - 18 hours flying time. It will achieve this with awesomely powerful 489kN (110,000lb) thrust GE90-110B1 turbofans, a significantly increased max takeoff weight and optional auxiliary fuel tanks in the rear cargo hold. Other changes include 2m (6.5ft) raked wingtips, new main landing gear, structural strengthening and optional overhead crew and flight attendant rest stations above the cabin. The 777-200LR was launched in 2000, but is now delayed until 2006. \r\n\r\nThe stretched 777-300 is described separately. \r\n\r\n"}, {"relatedLinks": "Boeing 777-300", "capacity": "Flightcrew of two.

Compared to the older 747s the stretched 777 has comparable passenger capacity and range, but burns one third less fuel and features 40% lower maintenance costs. \r\n\r\nCompared with the baseline 777-200 the 300 features a 10.13m (33ft 3in) stretch, comprising plugs fore and aft of the wings. The longer fuselage allows seating for up to 550 passengers in a single class high density configuration. To cope with the stretch and the up to 13 tonne (28,600lb) increased max takeoff weight the 300 features a strengthened undercarriage, airframe and inboard wing. Other changes compared with the 777-200 include a tailskid and ground manoeuvring cameras mounted on the horizontal tail and underneath the forward fuselage. Otherwise changes have been kept to a minimum to maximise commonality. \r\n\r\nBoeing publicly announced it was developing the 777-300 at the Paris Airshow in mid June 1995 where it revealed it had secured 31 firm orders from All Nippon, Cathay Pacific, Korean Airlines and Thai Airways. Later that month Boeing's board authorised production of the new aircraft. \r\n\r\nThe 777-300 rolled out on September 8 1997, followed by first flight on October 16 that year. The type made history on May 4 1998 when it was awarded type certification simultaneously from the US FAA and European JAA and was granted 180min ETOPS approval. Service entry with Cathay Pacific was later in that month. \r\n\r\nLike the 777-200, a 777-300ER long range version has been developed. Changes made to the 777-300ER are more powerful General Electric GE90-115B engines (currently the world's most powerful jet engine), raked wingtips, strengthened body, wings, empennage, nose gear, engine struts and nacelles, new main landing gear, and provision for extra fuel tanks. The range, carrying 365 passengers, is increased up to 13,427km (7,250nm).\r\n\r\nRoll-out of the first 777-300ER was made on November 14 2002, followed by the first flight on February 24 2003.

The aircraft was renamed the Boeing 787 in 2005.\r\n\r\nThis important design marked a major shift in technology for Boeing, which aimed for maximum fuel efficiency in a number of ways. Chief among these was a radical change of construction material, with much of the aircraft being built of carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP). Additionally, the fuselage was produced as 'barrels' rather than sheets of material, reducing the number of fastenings required. This further increased the weight savings. Many of the aircraft's systems are now electrically operated, replacing the heavier hydraulic systems of earlier Boeing designs with lighter technology.\r\n\r\nThe engines are new designs with increased fuel efficiency. Both the General Electric GEnx and Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 designs are available. Boeing decided to use bleedless designs, another major change for aircraft of this class. Interestingly, Airbus decided not to use bleedless technology on its competing Airbus A350 design and it remains to be seen which approach offers the greatest benefits over the other. The rear engine nacelle has a distinctive rippled look which reduces noise as the engine exhaust and external air mix.\r\n\r\nFor passengers, there have been a number of technology improvements. Most noticeably, the windows are amongst the largest in a civil airliner and are lower on the fuselage than is usual, so that passengers have a better view downwards. The lighting system use LED technology allowing each customer great flexibility on the lighting schemes it can use. The pressurisation system features a lower cabin altitude than normal and allows increased humidity, both factors which will contribute to passenger comfort during a long flight.\r\n\r\nWith all these technology advances and a distributed manufacturing program that was very new to Boeing, it is not suprising that the program encountered a number of delays.

The prototype, Boeing Model 299, first flew on July 28, 1935 and the first Y1B-17 of a production order of thirteen was delivered to the Air Corps in March, 1937. In January, 1939 an experimental Y1B-17A fitted with turbo-supercharged engines was delivered to the Army Air Corps. Following successful trials with this aircraft an order for 39 was placed for this model under the designation B-17B.\r\n\r\nThe B-17G was introduced onto the Fortress production line in July of 1943, and was destined to be produced in larger numbers than any other Fortress variant. The most readily-noticeable innovation introduced by the B-17G was the power-operated Bendix turret mounted in a chin-type installation underneath the nose. This turret was equipped with two 0.50-inch machine guns. This installation had first been tested in combat by the YB-40 and was found to be the only viable innovation introduced by the unsuccessful escort Fortress. Another innovation introduced by the G was having the waist guns being permanently enclosed behind windows instead of being mounted behind removable hatches. This made the rear fuselage somewhat less drafty. The cheek nose guns introduced on the late B-17F were retained, but were staggered so that the left gun was in the forward side window and the right gun was in the middle side window, which reversed the positions used on the late Fs. The cheek gun mounts bulged somewhat outward into the airstream, which helped to improve the forward view from the cheek gun positions. The forward chin installation and the associated cheek guns were first tested out on B-17F-115-BO 42-30631. Originally, the Bendix turret was to be introduced on the Boeing production line with F-135, but the changes were sufficient to justify a new series letter, and the F-135s became G-1. \r\n\r\nThe B-17G now had the defensive firepower of no less than thirteen 0.50-inch machine guns: two chin guns, two cheek guns, two guns in the dorsal turret, two guns in the ventral turret, two guns in the waist, two guns in the tail and one gun in the roof of the radio operator's position. B-17Gs were built by all three members of the \"B.V.D.\" production pool, with the Boeing lots ranging from production blocks G-1 to G-110, the Douglas blocks ranging from -5 to -95, and the Lockheed-Vega blocks ranging from -1 to -110.\r\n\r\nThe B-17G entered service with the Eighth and Fifteenth Air Forces in late 1943. Camouflage paint was deleted from production B-17Gs starting in January of 1944. B-17Gs were delivered in natural metal finish starting in (but not at the beginning) of production blocks G-35-BO (Boeing), G-20-VE (Lockheed-Vega), and G-35-DL (Douglas-Long Beach). The so-called \"Cheyenne\" tail gun mounting modifications were incorporated in the B-17G-80-BO, -45-DL, -35-VE and subsequent batches. These tail gun mountings also had a reflector gunsight instead of the previous ring and bead. With this installation, these B-17Gs were five inches shorter than the earlier versions. On later production versions, it was found necessary to stagger the waist gun positions so that the two gunners would not get in each other's way. On the last production batches (B-17G-105 and -110-BO, B-17G-75 to -85-DL, and B-17G-85 to -110-VE), the radio compartment gun was not installed. The ammunition capacity of the waist guns was increased to 600 rpg. When production terminated in 1945, a total of 4035 B-17Gs had been built by Boeing, 2395 by Douglas and 2250 by Lockheed-Vega. The last Boeing-built B-17G was delivered on April 13, 1945. B-17G-1-VE 42-38940 was redesignated XB-17G when assigned to test work.

The B-29 flew for the first time in September 1942 by which time Boeing had already studied a transport version, utilising the B-29's wing, engines, tail and lower fuselage, combined with a new upper fuselage section. The new double lobe fuselage shape was very distinctive, and also formed the basis for future Boeing jet airliner fuselage cross sections. \r\n\r\nThe US Army Air Force was impressed with Boeing's proposals and ordered three prototypes be built, the first of which flew on November 15 1944. Ten development YC-97s were subsequently ordered, the last of which represented production aircraft, featuring the more powerful R-4360 engines and taller tail developed for the B-50, an improved B-29. The first production C-97A was delivered in October 1949. \r\n\r\nDevelopment of the C-97 led to the C-97C, which was used for casualty evacuation, and the KC-97E, KC-97F and KC-97G aerial tankers. More than 590 KC-97Gs were built. The KC-97 was the US Air Force's primary tanker until replaced by the jet powered KC-135, the predecessor to the Boeing 707. Small numbers of 377 Stratocruiser airliners were also built, but the last of these have long been retired. \r\n\r\nMany Stratofreighters survived their military service to be acquired by civilian operators for use as freighters and fire bombers.

At the time of the takeover development on the X-70 training biplane was well advanced, and Stearman continued work on the type under Boeing ownership. The prototype of the Stearman Model 75, as the X70 became, flew for the first time in 1936. That year Stearman delivered the first production Model 35s, as the PT13, to the US Army Air Corps. That service immediately found the Lycoming R680 powered PT13 to be an ideal basic trainer, the airframe was rugged and forgiving, and the slow turning radial engine reliable and reasonably economical. \r\n\r\nAmerica's entry into World War 2 brought with it massive requirements for pilot training and the US Army and Navy went on to buy thousands of PT13s and Continental engined PT17s and N2Ss. During the war almost all American pilots undertook basic training on the PT13 or PT17, and the type was exported to Canada (as the Kaydet), Britain and other nations. Apart from in Canada the Kaydet name was unofficially widely adopted for the type. \r\n\r\nPostwar, the Stearman's rugged construction and good low speed handling saw large numbers converted for agricultural spraying work. Many conversions involved replacing the Stearman's fabric covering with metal (to avoid problems with chemical contamination), while many were fitted with more powerful 335kW (450hp) P&W R985A61 radials. \r\n\r\nToday many hundred Stearmans are still flown in private hands, although its crop spraying days are mostly over. \r\n\r\n"}, {"relatedLinks": "Boeing Vertol (Kawasaki) KV 107", "capacity": "Flightcrew of two.

As originally proposed the 170 was to be powered by improved sleeve valve Bristol Perseus radials.\r\n\r\nThe 170 soon caught the British Air Staff's attention which considered the design well suited for use in the India-Burma theatre carrying supplies and vehicles to jungle strips. Two prototypes were ordered with a slightly enlarged fuselage and more powerful Hercules 630 radials.\r\n\r\nThe 170 made its first flight from Filton on December 2 1945 and while it was too late to be ordered into production for military service in WW2 the type's potential had been demonstrated. The second prototype, configured in 32 seat Wayfarer airliner form (without the nose freight doors) flew the following April. Civil certification was granted in June 1946.\r\n\r\nEarly production was of the Mk1 Freighter and Mk2 Wayfarer. The Mk11 (later the Mk21) was unveiled at the 1947 SBAC airshow and introduced rounded wingtips and more powerful Hercules 672 engines, allowing an increase in gross weight of 1360kg (3000lb). The Mk31 introduced more powerful engines and remained in production until 1950.\r\n\r\nThe final 170 model is the Mk32, developed at the request of Silver City Airways.

Under the designation HS-146, large scale development lasted just a few months before a worsening economic recession made the risk of the project seem unjustifiable. Development then continued on a limited scale, but it was not until July 1978 that the project was officially relaunched, by which time Hawker Siddeley had been absorbed into the newly created British Aerospace. \r\n\r\nThe resulting BAe-146-100 made its first flight on September 3 1981. Certification was granted in early 1983 with first deliveries following shortly afterwards in May 1983. A VIP version was offered as the \"Statesman\" which was ordered by the Royal Air Force as the BAe-146 CC2, the standard transport version being the BAe-146 C1. An air refuel receptacle equipped military version, the -100STA flew in prototype form only. \r\n\r\nThe BAe-146-200 is a stretch of the 146-100, and is essentially similar to its smaller stablemate, but has a 2.39m (7ft 8in) longer fuselage, features 35% greater underfloor cargo volume, has slightly different performance figures and heavier weights. The stretch consists of five extra fuselage frame pitches. The first BAe-146-200 made the type's maiden flight on August 1 1982, while the UK Civil Aviation Authority awarded the 146-200s type certificate on February 4 the following year.\r\n\r\nVersions of the 146-200 include the -200QT Quiet Trader freighter, which has been fairly succesful because of its low external noise footprint, and the -200QC (Quick Change) passenger or freight convertible.\r\n\r\nThe 146-300 is a further stretched derivative of the original short fuselage BAe-146-100, but unlike the midsize 200 series, was not developed until later in the 1980s. The first 146-300, an aerodynamic prototype based on the original prototype 146-100, flew for the first time on May 1 1987, with certification granted that September.\r\n\r\nLike the 146-200, a freighter version of the 300 series is known as the 146-300QT Quiet Trader. The prototype -300 was converted to 146-301ARA configuration, an atmospheric research aircraft operated by the Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements as a replacement for the previously operated Hercules W2.\r\n\r\nThe last of the original 146s were built in 1993, with the series succeeded by the Avro 146-RJ family, described separately.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n"}, {"relatedLinks": "British Aerospace Jetstream 31/Super 31", "capacity": "Flightcrew of two.

Initial Handley Page production aircraft were powered by 635kW (850hp) Astazou XIVs and named Jetstream 1 (36 built), but deliveries were delayed by excess weight and drag problems. To overcome these problems Handley Page developed the Jetstream 2 with more powerful 800kW (1073shp) Astazou XIVCs. However Handley Page ran into serious financial difficulties in the late 1960s (causing the US Air Force to cancel an order for 10 Garrett TPE331 powered C-10A Jetstreams [3Ms]) and it folded in 1969, bringing to an end development of the more powerful Jetstream 2 and plans to market a civil version of the 3M in the USA. \r\n\r\nA few unfinished aircraft were completed by Terravia, and development of the Jetstream 2 resumed in 1970 as the Jetstream 200 under the control of the newly formed Jetstream Aircraft in collaboration with Scottish Aviation. Scottish Aviation later assumed overall responsibility for the Jetstream and built a number as navigation and multi-engine trainers for Britain's military services as the Jetstream T1 and T2. Development continued after Scottish Aviation was merged into British Aerospace in 1977, and work on the Jetstream 31 (or J31) began in 1978. The first flight of the Garrett TPE331 powered Jetstream 31 (a converted HP-137) occurred on March 28 1980. The first production aircraft flew in March 1982, UK certification was granted in June 1982. In British Naval service the J31 is designated the Jetstream T3. \r\n\r\nSubsequent development led to the Super 31, certificated in October 1988. The Super 31 (or unofficially J32) features uprated engines, higher weights and better performance. The last J31/J32 was built in 1993. \r\n\r\nSince 1997 British Aerospace Asset Management has been offering for sale or lease the upgraded J32EP (Enhanced Performance).

The company's novel approach to the need for more power was to add a third engine, rather than two engines of increased power output. A nose mounted engine in the fashion of the Ju-52 was considered, but due to the Islander's nose configuration, BrittenNorman settled on mounting the engine on the vertical tail, resulting in the BN-2A Mk.3 Trislander. \r\n\r\nThe tail mounted engine involved significant modification to the tail and strengthening of the rear fuselage. Other changes over the Islander include a 2.29m (7ft 6in) fuselage stretch forward of the wing, new main landing gear and larger diameter wheels and tyres. \r\n\r\nThe first Trislander was in fact converted from the second Islander prototype, and it made the type's first flight on September 11 1970. Early production Trislanders were also conversions of Islanders, while subsequent Trislanders were built on the same production line as the Islander. The first production Trislander flew on March 6 1971, certification was granted on May 14, and first deliveries to a customer occurred on June 29 that year. \r\n\r\nBritten-Norman Trislander production ceased in 1982 after 73 were ordered (by which stage the company had been acquired by Pilatus). Plans to produce the Trislander in the USA as the TriCommutair by the International Aviation Corporation, and in Australia never came to fruition.

What resulted was the CP-107 Argus. which was licence built on the base of the Bristol Britannia. The Argus differed from the Britannia in a number of significant respects - it was powered by Wright Turbo Compound radial engines (selected in place of turboprops to give better endurance and low speed performance at low altitude), and a redesigned unpressurised fuselage incorporating a weapons bay. With Canadair already producing the Argus, it was a relatively simple matter to offer a Britannia based design to meet an RCAF requirement for a transport to replace the aging DC-4M Northstar.\r\n\r\nThe transport became the CC-106 Yukon (or to Canadair, the CL-44-6). Twelve were built, featuring Rolls Royce Tyne turboprops, lengthened fuselage with two large conventional side freight doors. The wings and tail plane, landing gears and cockpit were kept mostly the same as on the Britannia. The first Yukon flew on November 15 1959. It also featured some extra military stuff which was not taken up on the civillian version. This included an APU, elektrik trimming, enhanced radar, transportable loading system etc. \r\n\r\nCanadair then began to offer the Yukon to commercial customers and developed the CL-44D-4, which featured a hinged tail which considerably simplified loading. (Swingtail) Due to new FAA/CAA regulations on visibility requirements the Britannia type winshields were replaced by newer and bigger windshield originating from the Convair 880. The first CL-44D-4 flew on November 16 1960, and at that time the model was the largest and first commercial freighter in the world to offer a 30t turn around in less then 60 minutes. The CL-44 is the first modern aircarft specially built for the commercial freight market. \r\n\r\nWhile all CL-44s in civil service have sooner or later been used as freighters, Loftleidir Icelandic Airline operated four CL-44Js plus a single CL-44D-4 in passenger configuration. The J, or  \"Rolls Royce 400 JetProp\", differed from the D-4s in that it featured a 4.62m (15ft 2in) fuselage stretch. It is the only aircraft to be redrawn from service, cut, stretched and put into service again. In late sixties the CL-44J was the largest passenger aircraft over the Atlantic ocean with 189 passengers. This was bigger then 707 and DC-8. \r\n\r\nOne CL-44 was converted by Conroy Aircraft in the US as a large volume freighter. Jack Conroy was hoping to get the lucratif contract to fly Rolls Royce engines for the Tristar. Instead Lockheed stretched their own L-100 and flew the engines themselves. The CL-44-O \"Guppy\" got a new voluminous cargo hold (similar to the Boeing 377ST Super Guppy conversions), and it flew after conversion for the first time on November 26 1969. \r\n\r\nAll military Yukons found their way into civil service in Africa and South America after retirement in 1973. In 2001 no J-model has survived. Only one Yukon is alive and six CL-44D-4 remain in poor condition.

Known as the LearStar 600, this design was first conceived in 1974. Notable for its large size cabin, the LearStar promised long range and good operating economics and was also one of the first aircraft to be designed with a supercritical wing. Lear initially planned that the LearStar would be a trijet, but the design had evolved to become a twin by the time Canadair purchased the rights. \r\n\r\nAs the CL-600 Challenger, Canadair launched development of the LearStar design on October 29 1976 with 53 firm orders. Canadair made a small number of changes to the design including repositioning the horizontal tailplane to the top of the fin rather than on the fuselage. \r\n\r\nThree development Challengers were built, the first of which flew for the first time on November 8 1978, the others flying in March and July the following year. However the first aircraft crashed in a deep stall accident and while certification was granted in August 1980, temporary restrictions limited maximum takeoff weight to 14,970kg (33,000lb) and maximum speed to 587km/h (317kt), with flight into known icing conditions and the use of thrust reversers prohibited. \r\n\r\nA major weight and drag reduction program pared back the Challenger's weight, improving range. The addition of General Electric CF-34 turbofans as options to the Challenger 601 (described separately under Bombardier), further addressed performance shortfalls and overcame problems with the ALF-502 turbofan. \r\n\r\nOne version that failed to see the light of day was the Challenger 610E, which would have featured a fuselage stretch allowing seating for 24 passengers, but Canadair suspended development in 1981. \r\n\r\nProduction of the 600 ceased in 1983, having switched to the much improved 601.

The Emeraude first flew in 1962 and was built in basic 50kW (65hp) Continental A65 power CP-30 form and 65kW (90hp) Continental C90 CP-301 Super Emeraude form. \r\n\r\nOne of the companies to build the Emeraude was CAARP, a company owned by Auguste Mudry. CAARP used the basic Emeraude design as the basis for the CAP-10, which was a similar aircraft other than its 135kW (180hp) Lycoming IO-360 engine and stressing for aerobatic flight. The prototype CAP-10 first flew in August 1968. CAARP built 30 CAP-10s for the French air force before Mudry started production for civil orders in 1972 at his other aviation company, Avions Mudry. \r\n\r\nThe CAP-10 remains in production today in 10B form with an enlarged tail. The CAP-20 meanwhile was a single seat development with a 150kW (200hp) AIO-360 engine. \r\n\r\nThe updated CAP-21 replaced the CAP-20 in 1981. The CAP-21 combined the fuselage of the CAP-20 with an all new wing and new undercarriage, and forms the basis for the similar CAP-231, CAP-231EX (with a carbon fibre wing) and latest CAP-232. \r\n\r\nFollowing Mudry's bankruptcy in 1996, Akrotech Europe took over the CAP series in May 1997, and in January 1999 changed name to CAP Aviation. \r\n\r\n"}, {"relatedLinks": "CASA C212 Aviocar", "capacity": "Flightcrew of two.

Further improvements led to the CASA CN235-200 and similar IPTN CN235-220 with increased operating weights, better field performance and greater range, with structural improvements and improved leading edge flaps and rudder. The CN235-220 was certificated in March 1992.

CASA later developed the stretched C-295, primarily for military use. \r\n\r\nThe CN235 has succeeded in achieving only a small number of commercial orders, mostly from Indonesian and Spanish operators.

Even so, Cessna thought 172 production would be shortlived as the similarly powered but more modern 177 Cardinal was released at the same time. In spite of the Cardinal, the Lycoming powered 172 was a runaway success and easily outsold and outlived its intended replacement. \r\n\r\nThe first O-320 Skyhawk was the 172I introduced in 1968. The 1969 172K introduced a redesigned fin, reshaped rear windows and optional increased fuel capacity, while 1970's 172K sported conical camber wingtips and a wider track undercarriage. The 172L in production in the 1971/72 model years was the first to feature the enlarged dorsal fin fillet. \r\n\r\nThe 172M of 1973/76 gained a drooped wing leading edge for improved low speed handling. The 172M was also the first to introduce the optional `II' package of higher standard equipment. Also in 1976 Cessna stopped marketing the aircraft as the 172. \r\n\r\nThe 172N was powered by a 120kW (160hp) O-320-H designed to run on 100 octane fuel, but the engine proved troublesome and was replaced by the similarly rated O-320-D in the 172P of 1981.

It was not until the signing of the General Aviation Revitalisation Act by the US President in August 1994 that Cessna announced it would resume light aircraft production. \r\n\r\nThe new 172R Skyhawk is based on the 172N (the previous major Skyhawk production model), but features a fuel injected Textron Lycoming IO-360-L2A engine. Cessna says it is significantly quieter than the O-320 it replaced as it produces its max power at only 2400rpm. \r\n\r\nOther changes include a new interior with contoured front seats which adjust vertically and recline, an all new multi level ventilation system, standard four point intercom, interior soundproofing, and energy absorbing 26g seats with inertia reel harnesses. \r\n\r\nThe 172R features epoxy corrosion proofing, stainless steel control cables, a dual vacuum pump system, tinted windows, long range fuel tanks, backlit instruments with non glare glass and an annunciator panel. 172R options include two avionics packages (one with GPS, the other with IFR GPS and a single axis autopilot) and wheel fairings. \r\n\r\nAn engineering prototype 172R (a converted 1978 172N) powered by an IO-360 first flew in April 1995, while the first new build pilot production 172R first flew on April 16 1996. This aircraft was built at Wichita, while production 172Rs are built at an all new factory in Independence, Kansas. \r\n\r\nThe higher performance 172S Skyhawk SP is pitched at `owner-users'.

A perceived shortcoming of the initial model was a lack of power, this was addressed with the 135kW (180hp) O-360-A powered 177A introduced in late 1968. The increase in engine power and hence performance lifted the 177 into a more upmarket four seater market niche between the 172 and 182. \r\n\r\nThe 1970 model 177B introduced a revised aerofoil, conical camber wingtips, cowl flaps and a constant speed propeller.

Cessna looked at an all new fuselage cross section for the Sovereign but opted instead to stretch the Excel fuselage (by 1.5m/4.9ft) to keep down costs and reduce development time. Even so Cessna claims the Sovereign's eight seat cabin is the largest in its class with 40% more volume than the Bombardier Learjet 60 and 18% more than the Raytheon Hawker 800XP. \r\n\r\nPower for the Sovereign will be from two FADEC equipped 25.3kN (5690lb) Pratt & Whitney Canada PW-306Cs.

Due to fly in the second quarter of 1999 and be certificated 12 months later, the CJ2 will feature a 89cm (35in) cabin and 43cm (17in) tailcone stretch allowing standard seating for six in the main cabin. Like the CJ1 it will feature Collins Pro Line 21 EFIS avionics, plus uprated FJ44-2C engines, increased span wings, larger area tail, six cabin windows per side and greater range.

American found the 110 (which first flew on July 8 1946) to be too small and asked that the 110 be scaled up in size, and this resulted in the 240 ConvairLiner. The 240 was arguably the most advanced short haul airliner of its day, and first flew on March 16 1947 and entered service on June 1 1948. \r\n\r\nThe success of the 240 led to the 1.37m (4ft 6in) stretched 340, which first flew on October 5 1951, and the improved 440 Metropolitan which incorporated extra cabin sound-proofing, new rectangular exhaust outlets, tighter engine cowlings, and some other aerodynamic improvements and first flew on October 6 1955. Most of the 440s were also delivered with weather radar in an elongated nose, which had been an option on the 340. \r\n\r\nThe 240, 340 and 440 sold in large numbers, mainly to airlines in North America, and formed the backbone of many airlines' short to medium haul fleets. Today the small number of piston Convairs that remain in service are mainly used as freighters.\r\n\r\nMany of the Convairs were also built for the US Air Force as the C-131 and T-29 in many versions, and for the US Navy as the R4Y which were redesignated too as C-131 in 1962. \r\n\r\nHowever, the original piston Convairs have been the subject of a number of turboprop modification programs, the line's inherent strength and reliability making it a popular choice for conversions.  \r\n\r\nAs early as 1950 the potential of turboprop powered 240s was recognised, leading to the first flight and development of the 240-21 Turboliner, while an Allison 501D powered YC-131C military conversion first flew on June 19 1954. One other early conversion occurred in 1954 when D Napier and Sons in Britain converted 340s with that company's 2280kW (3060hp) Eland N.El.1 turboprops as the 540. Six such aircraft were converted for Allegheny Airlines in the USA, although these aircraft were later converted back to piston power. Canadair meanwhile built 10 new aircraft with Eland engines as the CL-66 for the Royal Canadian Air Force, where they were designated CC-109 Cosmopolitan. \r\n\r\nThe most popular Convair conversions were those done by PacAero in California for Allison, and this involved converting 340s and 440s to 580s with Allison 501D turboprops, plus modified tail control surfaces and a larger tail area. The first such conversion flew on January 19 1960, although it was not until June 1964 that a converted aircraft entered service. \r\n\r\nConvair's own conversion program involved Rolls Royce Darts, and the first of these flew on May 2 1965. Thus converted 240s became 600s, while 340s and 440s became 640s. \r\n\r\nSuper 580 Aircraft Company, a division of Flight Trails Inc., replaced the Allison 501-D13D engines by -D22Gs and incorporated some further improvements on two or three 580s which were redesignated Super 580.\r\n\r\nKelowna Flightcraft in Canada however has offered the most ambitious Convair conversion program, the 5800, having stretched the 580 by 4.34m (14ft 3in) and reverting to the 440's original tail unit. Production conversions have a new freight door and digital avionics with EFIS.\r\n\r\nMost of the remaining Convairs are now used as cargo transports. \r\n \r\n\r\n"}, {"relatedLinks": "Curtiss C46 Commando", "capacity": "Flightcrew of two pilots and optional flight engineer.

The CW-20 featured two 1270kW (1700hp) Wright R2600 Twin Cyclone radial engines, twin vertical tails and a pressurised double lobe, or `double bubble' fuselage. Accommodation would have been for 36 passengers plus four crew. <p>Later in timing than the DC-3, the CW20 first flew on March 26 1940. In July that year an impressed US Army Air Force ordered 20 unpressurised CW20s, which it named the C46 Commando. The first production aircraft was completed in May 1942, by which time the powerplant choice had been switched to P&W R2800s, and the first deliveries to the US Army occurred that July. <p>Initially the C46 was troubled with reliability problems in military service, but these were soon overcome and the Commando proved to be a useful transport with its relatively cavernous freight hold. <p>A proposed postwar commercial version was the CW20E, but it failed to attract customer interest and thus all Commandos to enter civilian service were ex military aircraft. Most were purchased by American operators for freight work. One postwar version though was the Riddles Airlines C46R which had more powerful engines and better performance. Thirty or so were converted. <p>In late 1998 five Commandos were believed to be operational in Alaska, four in Canada, and as many as seven in Bolivia. <p>"}, {"relatedLinks": "Dassault Falcon 2000", "capacity": "Flightcrew of two.

From the start the Falcon 2000 was designed with a range of 5560km (3000nm) in mind, which is less than the transcontinental 900's range. This design range removed the need for the redundancy of three engines for long range overwater flights, allowing the two new CFE738 engines to be fitted, which offer considerable maintenance and operating economics benefits. The CFE738 engine was developed specifically for the Falcon 2000 by a partnership of General Electric and AlliedSignal, known as CFE. Meanwhile, the 2000's fuselage is 1.98m (6ft 6in) shorter than the 900's and so houses less fuel, passengers and baggage. <p>Another noticeable design change between the 900 and 2000 is the area ruled rear fuselage. Dassault engineers found that the three engine layout of the 900 to be aerodynamically efficient, whereas the twin engine design of the 2000 originally would have been comparatively draggy. To combat this and reduce drag to desired levels Dassault designed an area ruled (or Coke bottle) rear fuselage, using its Catia three dimensional computer aided design program. <p>Changes to the wing include a modified leading edge and the inboard slats have been removed, while the cockpit features a Collins four screen EFIS avionics system with optional Flight Dynamics head-up displays (allowing hand flown approaches in Cat II and Cat IIIa conditions). <p>Dassault has a number of industry partners in the Falcon 2000 program, foremost of these being Alenia, which is a 25% risk sharing partner.

The prototype, \"Spirit of Lafayette\", flew for the first time on September 21 1984. A second prototype flew on August 30 1985, and this aircraft demonstrated the type's long range potential by flying nonstop from Paris to Little Rock, Arkansas in the USA for a demonstration tour.

Design leadership for DHC's first aircraft was the responsibility of W J Jakimiuk who had emigrated to Canada from Poland in 1940 and was previously responsible for the design of the PZL P-24 and PZL P-50 Jastrzab fighters and the DH-95 Flamingo airliner. \r\n\r\nHis new aircraft was designated the DHC-1 Chipmunk and flew for the first time on May 22 1946. Features of the design included a De Havilland Gipsy Major engine and all metal construction (but with fabric covered control surfaces). First deliveries took place the following year. Main Chipmunk models included the Canadian built DHC-1A-1 and DHC-1B-2 (Mk1 and Mk2 in the RCAF), and many featured clear view blown canopies, while main British production models included the initial T10 for the RAF, the Mk20 for foreign military users and the civilian Mk21. OGMA built 60 Mk20 under licence in Portugal. \r\n\r\nCivilianised versions of RAF aircraft became available in large numbers from the late 1950s, and the T10 became the Mk22 in civil service, while the Mk22A was a Mk22 with greater fuel capacity. Farm Aviation Services in the UK heavily modified Chipmunks with a hopper tank in place of the forward cockpit for spraying duties, these aircraft were designated Mk23s. Three similar conversions were performed in Australia by Sasin/Aerostructures as the SA-29 Spraymaster. The Masefield Chipmunk was a conversion available for ex RAF T10s with a blown canopy, wheel pants, luggage space in the wing and increased fuel capacity.\r\n\r\nIn 1999 a kit version became available for the homebuilt market, developed by Gilles Leger in Montreal, Canada.

The Caribou was primarily a military tactical transport that in commercial service found itself a small niche. \r\n\r\nDe Havilland Canada designed the DHC-4 in response to a US Army requirement for a tactical airlifter to supply the battlefront with troops and supplies and evacuate casualties on the return journey. With assistance from Canada's Department of Defence Production, DHC built a prototype demonstrator that flew for the first time on July 30 1958. \r\n\r\nImpressed with the DHC4's STOL capabilities and potential, the US Army ordered five for evaluation as YAC-1s and went on to become the largest Caribou operator, taking delivery of 159. The AC-1 designation was changed in 1962 to CV-2, and then C-7 when the US Army's CV-2s were transferred to the US Air Force in 1967. US and Australian Caribou saw extensive service during the Vietnam conflict. In addition some US Caribou were captured by North Vietnamese forces and remained in service with that country through to the late 1970s. Other notable military operators included Canada, Malaysia, India and Spain. \r\n\r\nThe majority of Caribou production was for military operators, but the type's ruggedness and excellent STOL capabilities also appealed to a select group of commercial users. US certification was awarded on December 23 1960. AnsettMAL, which operated a single example in the New Guinea highlands, and AMOCO Ecuador were early customers, as was Air America (a CIA front in South East Asia during the Vietnam War era for covert operations). Other Caribou entered commercial service after being retired from their military users. \r\n\r\nToday only a handful are in civil use as the Caribou's thirsty twin row radial engines make commercial operations uneconomic where its STOL performance is not a factor. \r\n\r\nInterest in the Caribou could be revived however, as Pen Turbo from Cape May, NJ has made a conversion with Pratt & Whitney PT6A-67T turbine engines with 5-bladed Hartzell propellers, named the DHC-4A Turbo Caribou, and is now offering this modification on the market under a STC (Supplemental Type Certificate).

The 100A introduced a revised interior with extra headroom and PW120A turboprops. The Series 100B was offered from 1992 with more powerful PW121s for better climb and airfield performance. \r\n\r\nProduction since switched to the improved performance Dash 8-200.

The 200B derivative has PW123Bs for better hot and high performance. \r\n\r\nFrom the second quarter of 1996 all Dash 8s delivered have been fitted with a computer controlled noise and vibration suppression system (or NVS). To reflect this the designation was changed to Dash 8Q (Q for `quiet').

The first series 300 aircraft was in fact the prototype Dash 8 converted to the new length, and it flew for the first time in its new configuration on May 15 1987. Flight testing culminated in the awarding of Canadian certification in February 1989, with the first delivery to Time Air following late that same month.

The standard 300 was followed in 1990 by the 300A which introduced optional higher gross weights, interior improvements (as on the Dash 8-100A), and standard PW123A engines (with PW123Bs optional). The 300B was introduced in 1992 and has 1865kW (2500shp) PW123Bs as standard, as is the optional high gross weight of the 300A. The 300E has 1775kW (2380shp) PW123Es rated to 40 degrees, thus improving hot and high performance. \r\n\r\nLike the Dash 8Q-200, all Dash 8-300s built since the second quarter of 1996 have been fitted with a computer controlled noise and vibration suppression system (or NVS) and so from then all models were designated Dash 8Q-300s.

Rolled out on November 21 1997, the Q400 made its first flight on January 31 1998. Five Q400s were used in the 1900 flying hour flight test program, culminating in Canadian certification being awarded on June 14, 1999, and US certification on February 8, 2000.

Despite the recent proliferation of regional jets, Bombardier notes that regional jets have created their own market niche and are not replacing turboprops, which remain more economical over shorter stage lengths. Bombardier says the Q400's breakeven load factor for a 360km (195nm) stage length will be just 29 passengers. \r\n\r\nThe Q400 features a new fuselage stretched 6.83m (22ft 5in) compared with the Q300 mated with the familiar Dash 8 nose section and vertical tail, while the horizontal tail is new.

The resulting aircraft featured new versions of the Gipsy Queen engine, a raised flightdeck and separate passenger cabin and all metal construction. The first DH.104 Dove flew for the first time on September 25 1945.\r\n\r\nSteady sales success as a regional airliner and corporate transport (particularly in the US) was boosted by significant military orders (RAF versions were known as the Devon, Royal Navy aircraft the Sea Devon).\r\n\r\nThe Dove remained in production until the mid 1960s (by which time it was a Hawker Siddeley product), and a number of variants were built.

In designing the Heron, de Havilland made as much use of Dove componentry as possible, and so both types feature the distinctive slightly raised cockpit and separate main cabin and metal construction. Initial Heron production aircraft also featured fixed undercarriage (unlike the retractable gear Dove). Major differences include the four 185kW (250hp) Gipsy Queen engines (as opposed to two 255 to 300kW/340 to 400hp Gipsy Queen 70s), greater span wings, a longer and taller fuselage and greater seating capacity. The first Series 1 production Herons were delivered to New Zealand National Airways in 1952. \r\n\r\nAlso in 1952 the first Series 2 Heron first flew on December 14. The 2's main improvement over the 1 was retractable undercarriage, which for a weight penalty of 75kg (165lb) increased cruising speed by 32km/h (17kt), while other standard and optional improvements were minor in nature. The Heron 2A was certificated for use in the USA, and an equivalent 2B executive version was also offered. The 2C and equivalent executive 2D have greater weights. \r\n\r\nThe Heron has been the subject of numerous conversion programs.

Based on the DH.60T Moth Trainer, the Tiger Moth first flew on October 26 1931. Like the earlier Moth and Gipsy Moth the new aircraft was a two place biplane and featured a Gipsy Major engine and wooden and metal construction. Difficulty bailing out in an emergency was a problem with the earlier aircraft, and this was addressed through repositioning the struts forward of the front cockpit. To counter centre of gravity problems that would have resulted, the wings were given a modest sweepback angle. <p>The DH.82 attracted the interest of Britain's Royal Air Force, and the first of what would ultimately be several thousand Tiger Moths entered service with the RAF in 1932. Initial production DH.82s were powered by 80kW (120hp) engines, while the DH.82A introduced in 1937 featured a 97kW (130hp) engine, and was the most produced version. Most prewar production was against military orders, although some civil machines were built. <p>As Britain's standard basic pilot training aircraft, production of the Tiger Moth increased greatly during WW2, and some 4000 were built in the UK. During the war large numbers were also built in Canada (as the DH.82C with a Gipsy Major IC or 120kW/160hp Pirate D.4 engine), Australia and New Zealand. <p>Postwar, surplus military Tiger Moths proved extremely popular with private owners. Many examples were converted for agricultural work, particularly in Australia and New Zealand, while small numbers of the four seat Jackaroo conversion were built from 1957. <p>Today the Tiger Moth remains very popular, and in some countries the Tiger Moth populations are in fact growing as retired machines are restored and returned to the air. <p>"}, {"relatedLinks": "Diamond DA-40 Diamond Star", "capacity": "Standard seating for four.", "dimensions": "Wing span 11.94m (39ft 5in), length 8.01m (26ft 3in), height 2.00m (6ft 7in).

In 1934 American Airlines requested that Douglas develop a larger more capable version of the DC2 for transcontinental US sleeper flights. The resulting DC-3 (or DST - Douglas Sleeper Transport as it then was) flew for the first time on December 17 1935. <p>An almost instant sales success, the DC-3 became the mainstay of the US domestic airline network in the years prior to World War 2. Aside from passenger comfort and appeal, the DC-3 offered that most important of virtues, profitability, with the result that over 400 had been sold to airlines prior to late 1941. <p>The entry of the United States into WW2 in December 1941 had a profound effect on the fortunes of the already successful DC-3. The US Army Air Force's requirements for transport aircraft were admirably met by the inproduction DC-3, with the result that as the C47 Skytrain it became the standard USAAF transport during the war. More than 10,000 were built for service with US and allied air arms. <p>After the war many of these aircraft became surplus to requirements and were sold off at bargain prices. The result was that demilitarised C47s became the standard postwar aircraft of almost all the world's airlines and the backbone of the world airline industry well into the 1950s. Its availability and reliability meant it proved extremely popular. Even today hundreds remain in service. <p>A postwar update of the DC-3, the Super DC-3, involving a stretched airframe and more powerful engines, was commercially unsuccessful. This aircraft first flew in June 1949. A small number were built for the US Navy as the R4D8 and for a US domestic airline, and a few remain in service. <p>"}, {"relatedLinks": "Douglas DC-4", "capacity": "Flightcrew of three, standard passenger seating for 44, max seating for 86.

This four engined behemoth was flight tested in 1939. It was roughly three times the size of the DC-3 (its wingspan was 42.17m/138ft 3in, and length 29.76m/97ft 7in), had triple tail surfaces, tricycle undercarriage, was pressurised and potentially could fly nonstop from Chicago to San Francisco. <p>However all the ground breaking new technology on the DC-4E meant that it was costly, complex and had higher than anticipated operating costs, so Douglas thoroughly revised the design, resulting in the smaller and simpler definitive DC-4. <p>The new DC-4 was developed under the darkening clouds of WW2, and upon the USA's entry into war all DC-4s then on the production line were requisitioned for the US military. The result was that the first DC-4 flew for the first time on February 14 1942 in military markings (as the C-54 Skymaster). The DC-4 was found to admirably suit the USAAF's requirement for a long range cargo transport, and 1162 were built through the war years. <p>As was the case with the DC-3, the end of war meant that much of that number were surplus and sold to the world's airlines. Further to this Douglas built an additional 78 DC-4s to new orders. Over the years the survivors have been passed down to charter and freight airlines, and today small numbers survive in service as freighters. <p>Notable developments of the DC-4 include Aviation Trader's much modified Carvair freighter (described separately) while Canadair built a number with RollsRoyce Merlin engines and pressurised fuselages. The DC-4 also formed the basis for the larger DC-6 and DC-7 which are described separately (the DC-4 was the first airliner to introduce a circular section, constant diameter fuselage which made stretching the basic aircraft relatively simple). <p>"}, {"relatedLinks": "Douglas DC-6", "capacity": "DC-6 - Flightcrew of three or four.

However the improved DC-4 (which would feature a 2.11m/6ft 11in fuselage stretch and P&W R-2800 Double Wasp engines) soon attracted the attention of the US Army Air Force, which devised a requirement which the new transport was developed against. A prototype was built, designated XC-112, but it did not fly until February 15 1946, by which time the war was over and the military requirement no longer stood.\r\n\r\nInstead Douglas continued development of the type as a long range airliner, resulting in the DC-6. The XC-112 served as the prototype for the DC-6 program. US airlines had already shown strong interest in the new transport, with launch orders for the DC-6 placed in September 1944. The first production DC-6 first flew in June 1946 and service entry, with United Air Lines, occurred on April 27 1947. However early service was not smooth with the fleet grounded for four months from November that year after two internal fuselage fires in flight, one being fatal, caused by fuel venting entering the cabin heater ram air intake. \r\n\r\nThe availability of the more powerful R-2800 engines with water/methanol injection prompted Douglas to develop the further stretched DC-6A Liftmaster freighter (first flight September 29 1949) and the equivalent passenger DC-6B (first flight February 2 1951). The DC-6C, the last DC-6 model to be developed, was a convertible passenger/freight version of the DC-6A.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile renewed military interest in the DC-6 was sparked by the Korean War, with the result that large numbers of USAF C-118s and USN R6D-1s were built.

As it emerged though the DC-7 arose from an American Airlines requirement for a stretched longer range development of the DC-6. The resulting aircraft was based on the same wing of the DC-6 (also the same basic wing designed for the DC-4), with a stretched DC-6 fuselage, more powerful Wright Turbo Compound engines and extra fuel allowing Douglas to guarantee it could offer nonstop transcontinental US range in both directions. \r\n\r\nThe prototype DC-7 flew for the first time on May 18 1953, and the type entered service with American that November. Production of the initial DC-7 was solely for US domestic operators. The improved DC-7B had the same dimensions as the DC-7, but carried extra fuel, allowing PanAm to inaugurate nonstop New York/London services from June 1955. \r\n\r\nWhile the DC-7B could fly New York/London nonstop, weather conditions often forced reverse services to make a refuelling stop at Gander. This operational hurdle gave Douglas the impetus to develop the ultimate DC-7 model, the DC-7C `Seven Seas'. The DC-7C featured extra fuel capacity, a 3.05m (10ft) fuselage stretch and more powerful engines, and could cross the North Atlantic nonstop in either direction. It entered service in April 1956, although sales were restricted by the coming availability of jets. \r\n\r\nToday a small number DC-7s survive, mainly as freighters.

Just nine and a half months passed before first flight on July 4 1998 (following rollout on May 12 that year). A second prototype first flew in October 1998, US FAA certification was awarded on July 16 1999 and first delivery was to Continental Express on July 23 1999. \r\n\r\nThe speed of the development program illustrates that the ERJ-135 is a fairly straightfoward development of the 145. Both 135 prototypes were converted from ERJ-145 prototypes, requiring little modification other than the removal of two fuselage plugs totalling 3.50m (11ft 6in) in length. \r\n\r\nOther changes compared with the -145 are minor. Both are powered by Rolls-Royce (Allison) AE-3007 turbofans but the ERJ-135's are derated by around 5%, achieved by a slight software change to the engines' FADEC system. The only other notable change is new valves in the air-conditioning system. \r\n\r\nLike the ERJ-145 therefore, the 135 also features a Honeywell Primus 1000 avionics suite with five large multifunction displays in the cockpit, a Sundstrand APU and three abreast seating in the main cabin. \r\n\r\nAlso in common with the ERJ-145, the 135 is offered in standard ERJ-135ER and extended range ERJ-135LR forms. The LR features an additional fuel tank and slightly more powerful AE-3007A4 turbofans. \r\n\r\nFew new airliners have sold as quickly from their launch as the ERJ-135. Building on the success of the 145, the 135's order book stood at 145 at late 1998, barely a year after launch. The aircraft's two biggest customers were American Eagle which ordered 75 and optioned 75 at the 1998 Farnborough Airshow to join 42 firm ordered ERJ-145s, and Continental Express with 25 firm and 50 optioned to complement 75 ERJ-145s it had on order.\r\n\r\nIn September 1999 Embraer launched the third member of its regional jet family, the 44 seat ERJ-140. The ERJ-140 is also a minimum change development, and differs from the 135 and 145 only in its fuselage length and seating capacity. First flight was on June 27 2000 and deliveries began in late July 2001.\r\n\r\nThe 140 is largely aimed at US airlines who have to contend with pilot labour agreement restrictions on the numbers of 50 seater jets they can operate. American Eagle was the launch customer.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile at Farborough 2000 Embraer launched development of the ERJ-135 based Legacy corporate jet. First flight (of a converted ERJ-135) was on March 2001. The Legacy features additional fuel giving a range with 10 passengers of 5930km (3200nm).\r\n\r\nAlthough the marketing designations are ERJ-135, ERJ-140 and Legacy, the certification designations remain as EMB-135ER/LR for the ERJ-135ER/LR, EMB-135KL for the ERJ-140LR and EMB-135BJ for the Legacy. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n"}, {"relatedLinks": "Embraer ERJ-145", "capacity": "Flightcrew of two.

The original EMB-145 (the marketing designation later became ERJ-145) was launched in mid 1989 and would have been a stretched and jet engined EMB-120 Brasilia. Features of this design included a straight wing with winglets and the two turbofans mounted forward of the wing as on most low wing turboprops. This design would have seated 45 to 50 passengers and featured 75% commonality with the Brasilia. In that configuration cruising speed would have been 740km/h (400kt) and range with a 4500kg (9920lb) payload 2500km (1350nm). \r\n\r\nBut by 1990 Embraer was studying a modified design with less commonality to the Brasilia as wind tunnel testing revealed that the original configuration would not reach its design performance objectives. Changes to this interim design included a mildly swept wing with winglets (wing sweep of 22.3\u00b0) and conventional below wing mounted engines. Wind tunnel testing proved that this configuration met design objectives however it had a major drawback in that it would have needed an unusually high undercarriage.\r\n\r\nThus in late 1991 Embraer froze the ERJ-145 design with rear fuselage mounted engines and T-tail, and no winglets. Other features include Rolls-Royce (Allison) AE-3007A turbofans and a Honeywell Primus 1000 EFIS avionics suite with five colour CRT screens in the flightdeck. The Brasilia's three abreast fuselage cross section was retained. \r\n\r\nThe ERJ-145's first flight took place on August 11 1995 with first deliveries from December 1996 to Continental Express. Continental's initial order for 25 was a major fillup for the program and opened the floodgates for a number of major sales. \r\n\r\nEmbraer has developed several versions of the ERJ-145, the initial ERJ-145ER, the higher max takeoff weight longer range ERJ-145LR introduced in 1998 and most recently the ERJ-145XR (Extra Long Range). The 145XR first flew on June 29 2001 and entered service in October 2002. It features uprated yet more fuel efficient 36kN (8110lb) engines, winglets, 24,100kg (53,131lb) max takeoff weight, a max cruising speed of Mach 0.8 (852km/h/460kt) and increased fuel capacity for a 3705km (2000nm) range. The ERJ-145EP and -EU are -ERs with different max takeoff weights, and the ERJ-145LU and -MP are -LRs with different max takeoff weights.\r\n\r\nOther EMB-145 developments are the AEW&C (Airborne Early Warning and Control) EMB-145SA with an Erieye radar on top of the fuselage (serving with the Brazilian Air Force as R-99A), the EMB-145AEW which is the export variant of the EMB-145SA (for Greece and Mexico), the EMB-145RS, a remote sensing variant (serving with the Brazilian Air Force as the R-99B and with the Mexican Air Force) and the maritime patrol and ASW EMB-145MP/ASW which will serve with the Brazilian Air Force as P-99. The standard EMB-145ER serves as the C-99A in the Brazilian Air Force.\r\n\r\nSince mid 2004, the ERJ-145 is also assembled in China by Harbin Embraer.\r\n\r\nThe shorter fuselage ERJ-135 and ERJ-140 and the corporate transport EMB-135BJ Legacy are described separately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n "}, {"relatedLinks": "Embraer ERJ-170/175/190/195", "capacity": "Flightcrew of two.\r\nERJ-170 - Standard seating for 70 at four abreast.\r\nERJ-175 - Standard seating for 78.\r\nERJ-190 - Standard seating for 98.\r\nERJ-195 - Standard seating for 108.", "dimensions": "ERJ-170 - Wing span over winglets 26,00m (85ft 4in), length 29,90m (98ft 1in), height 9.67m (31ft 9in).\r\nERJ-190 - Wing span over winglets 28.72m (94ft 3in), length 36.24m (118ft 11in), height 10.28m (33ft 9in).\r\nERJ-195 - Same as ERJ-190 except length 38.65m (126ft 10in).", "countryOfOrigin": "Brazil", "production": "By early 2005, 62 ERJ-170s, 2 ERJ-175s, 4 ERJ-190s and 1 ERJ-195 had been built, with a further 108 ERJ-170s, 25 ERJ-175s, 156 ERJ-190s and 15 ERJ-195s on order.", "weights": "ERJ-170 - Basic operating 20,150kg (44,422lb), standard max takeoff 35,450kg (78,153lb), LR max takeoff 48,500kg (106,922lb).\r\nERJ-195 - Basic operating 27,100kg (59,744lb), standard max takeoff 46,990kg (103,593lb), LR max takeoff 48,990kg (108,003lb).", "performance": "ERJ-170 - Max cruising speed Mach 0.82 or 890km/h (481kt).

The first F-28 prototype made its maiden flight on November 12 1960, with the production prototype of the F-28 flying in May 1962. Since that time numerous developments of the basic design have been built. These include the F-28A which appeared in 1968; the T-28 powered by a Garrett AiResearch TSE36-1 turbine engine, which flew in 1968, but was not taken into production, the Model 280 Shark from 1973, an improved version with a reprofiled airframe which supplemented the F-28A in production; and the turbocharged F-28C and 280C, which were certificated in 1975. \r\n\r\nThe prototype for the Allison (now Rolls-Royce) 250 turboshaft powered 480 five seater and TH-28 three seat trainer first flew in 1989 after a proof of concept 280FX testbed powered by an Allison 250-C20W began test flying the previous year. The 480 was certificated in June 1993, the TH-28, which Enstrom unsuccessfully entered into a recent US Army competition for a new pilot training helicopter, was certificated in 1992 and is aimed at training and light patrol work. \r\n\r\nCurrent Enstrom production models are the F-28F Falcon which first appeared in 1981; the FLIR pod equipped F-28F-P Sentinel which is optimised for police work; the three seat 280FX Shark which was certificated in early 1988; and the turbine powered 480 and TH-28. \r\n\r\n"}, {"relatedLinks": "Erco Ercoupe and derivatives", "capacity": "Seating for two side-by-side.", "dimensions": "415C - Wing span 9.14m (30ft 0in), length 6.15m (20ft 2in), height 1.90m (6ft 3in). \r\nF-1 - Same as 415C\r\nA-2 - Same as 415C, except length 6.20m (20ft 4in), wing area 13.2m2 (142.6sq ft).\r\nM-10 - Wing span 9.14m (30ft 0in), length 6.30m (20ft 8in), height 2.34m (7ft 8in), wing area 13.2m2 (142.6sq ft)", "countryOfOrigin": "United States of America", "production": "Total production amounts to 5,604 aircraft, comprising 1 model 310 and 4,872 model 415 built by Erco, 209 model 415 built by Sanders, 139 model F-1 built by Forney and Fornaire, 26 model F-1 built by Air Products, 244 model A-2 built by Alon, and 52 model A-2 and 61 model M-10 built by Mooney.", "weights": "415C - Empty 364kg (802lb), max takeoff 572kg (1260lb). \r\nF-1 - Empty 404-422kg (890-930lb), max takeoff 635kg (1400lb).\r\nA-2 - Empty 422kg (930lb), max takeoff 658kg (1450lb)\r\nM-10 - Empty 430kg (950lb), max takeoff 658kg (1450lb)\r\n", "performance": "415C - Max speed 188km/h (102kt), cruising speed 161km/h (87kt).

Fred Weick's research into safe airplanes was employed in the design. The rudder controls were eliminated and the aircraft was handled by the control wheel only, making it easy to fly and making stalls and spins almost impossible. Later models reverted to conventional rudder bars, as existing pilots tended to be confused by the system. A novel fixed tricycle landing gear for better ground handling was installed, and the cockpit was designed to have allround visibility.\r\n  \r\nThe aircraft was a low-wing cabin monoplane with side-by-side seating for two, and had an all-metal fuselage with fabric-covered wings, but later production had all-metal wings. The 310 was originally flown with a single fin, but during development this was replaced by twin tailfins. After three years of exhaustive testing, on March 25, 1940, the type certificate was issued to the production model, the 415C, which was powered by a 65hp Continental A-65-8 engine. Production was halted in 1941 after 112 aircraft had been built, as all aluminum was needed for the war effort. One 415C was evaluated by the Air Force as an observation aircraft, designated YO-55, and two more were tested as target drones, designated XPQ-13, but the aircraft was not found suitable for military service.\r\n\r\nIn August 1945 production of the 415C was resumed, with some improvements and a 75hp Continental C-75-12 engine. In February 1946, Fred Weick received the Fawcett Aviation Award for the greatest contribution to the scientific advancement of private flying. Post-war, Erco built 4,408 model 415C, 77 model 415D, and 275 model 415CD. In 1950, they ceased production of the Ercoupe because light aircraft production became uneconomic for them.\r\n\r\nProduction of the Ercoupe was handed over to Sanders, who completed 209 aircraft from Erco parts as the 415E (85hp Continental C-85-12 engine), 415F (90hp C-90), 415G ClubAir (85hp C-85-12 with an additional rear kid's seat), and 415H (75hp C-75). In 1954 the type certificate was sold to Vest aircraft, who did not built any aircraft, but sold it on to Forney in April 1955.\r\n\r\nForney produced 139 aircraft as the F-1 and F-1A Aircoupe with many details improved, and powered by a 90hp Continental C-90-12F engine. Forney changed name to Fornaire in 1959, and the F-1 was now available with differing standards of equipment as the Execta, Expediter, and Explorer. \r\n\r\nAir Products took over production in 1960 and built another 26 as the F-1A Aircoupe until 1962. In 1964 Alon started to build the design as the A-2 and A-2A Aircoupe with a 90hp Continental C-90-16F engine, a sliding bubble canopy, and other changes. Alon merged with Mooney in 1967, who continued to build the A-2A, but in 1969 they redesigned the aircraft with a single fin as the M-10 Cadet. In 1970 the last ones were produced.\r\n"}, {"relatedLinks": "Eurocopter AS 332 Super Puma", "capacity": "Flightcrew of one (VFR ops), or two (IFR ops) pilots.

From the Merlin I Swearingen developed the turboprop powered II and III which were to form the basis of the new Metro commuter airliner. The Metro was Swearingen's first complete inhouse design and development work began in the late 1960s, resulting in the SA226TC Metro's first flight on August 26 1969. The design was similar in appearance and layout to the earlier Merlins, and featured a pressurised fuselage, TPE331 turboprop engines and double slotted trailing edge flaps. Certification was awarded in June 1970 and the first example entered commercial service in 1973. \r\n\r\nThe Metro II superseded the I from 1975, with improvements to reduce cabin noise levels. The equivalent executive aircraft is the Merlin IV. Following the Metro II from 1981 was the III (by which time Fairchild had taken over Swearingen), which was certificated to SFAR41B allowing greater takeoff weights, while more efficient engines (including the option of Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6As on the IIIA) and greater wing span made the III more economical to operate. The Expediter freighter is based on the III. \r\n\r\nThe current Metro model is the 23. Certificated to FAR Part 23 (Amendment 34) standards (hence the Metro 23 designation) it features a higher takeoff weight, more powerful engines and systems improvements first introduced on the military C26. The Metro 23 EF has a bulged lower fuselage for greater baggage capacity, while the Merlin 23 and Expediter 23 models are also offered.

On August 8, 2000, Dornier Luftfahrt GmbH changed name to Fairchild Dornier GmbH. \r\n   \r\nDevelopment of the 328JET was launched soon after Fairchild Aerospace took over Dasa's stake in Dornier. A market survey of 50 regional airlines worldwide was launched which confirmed their customer driven preference for jet equipment, as long as the operating economics of a regional jet were competitive. Armed with this information, Fairchild launched the 328JET, a jet engined development of the 328 turboprop, in February 1997. \r\n\r\nThe most obvious change to the 328 for the 328JET is the addition of FADEC equipped Pratt & Whitney Canada PW306 turbofans mounted in underwing pods. Otherwise the 328JET was designed to be a minimum change development of the 328 turboprop to allow Fairchild to bring the aircraft to market as quickly as possible. Fairchild was able to achieve this because of the turboprop 328's conservative engineering and clean aerodynamic design. Just two fuselage frames (which the wing and landing gear attach to) required strengthening. A 10cm (4in) extension to the trailing edge flaps cuts aerodynamic drag. Other changes include strengthened landing gear and brakes, slight changes to the software of the Honeywell Primus 2000 EFIS avionics suite, and an APU is standard. \r\n\r\nThe first 328JET prototype was converted from the second 328 turboprop, and was rolled out on December 6 1997. It first flew from Munich in Germany on January 20 1998. Certification and first deliveries were in July 1999. \r\n\r\nFairchild Dornier considered two stretched developments of the 328JET, the 50 seat 528JET and the 42 to 44 seat PW306B powered 428JET. The 428JET was formally launched in May 1998 and would have been assembled in Israel by IAI, but Fairchild Dornier suspended the program in August 2000 due to not being able to make a viable business case.\r\n\r\nThe Envoy 3 is a corporate jet/corporate shuttle development of the 328JET with longer range.\r\n\r\nOn July 1 2002 Fairchild Dornier was declared insolvent and entered administration. In mid-2003 AvCraft Aerospace GmbH acquired the rights to the 328JET together with 18 completed aircraft.

Deliveries should have started in mid 2003 to Lufthansa Cityline. \r\n\r\nIn August 1998 Fairchild announced it had selected General Electric's FADEC equipped CF34-8D (which has 87% parts commonality with the CF34-8C1 selected to power the competing CRJ-700) ahead of the SNECMA/Pratt & Whitney Canada SPW-14 to power the 728. In September '98 further 728 suppliers were announced, including Honeywell for its Primus Epic integrated EFIS avionics suite with flat panel LCDs, AlliedSignal (APU and environmental control system), Lucas Aerospace (for a fly-by-wire flight control system), BFGoodrich (landing gear, wheels, tyres, brakes and fuel system), Hamilton Sundstrand (integrated electric system), and Parker Aerospace (hydraulics). CASA would build the wings and empennage. \r\n\r\nThe base version of the 728 was the 728-100, which would have been followed end 2003 by the extended range and higher payload 728-200. The 200 would have had a 3000kg (6615lb) higher MTOW and a 750km (400nm) increase in range.\r\n\r\nIn its class, the 728 had the largest cabin (0.51cm wider than the Embraer 170/190, and 0.70cm wider than the CRJ-700) with five-abreast seating.  \r\n\r\nFollowing the 728 into service would have been the stretched 95 to 110 seat 928, with first flight scheduled in late 2003, and entry into service in 2005. Apart from the stretched fuselage - cabin length from behind the flightdeck would have been 23.05m (75ft 7in) allowing seating for 95 to 110 passengers - it would also have featured an increased span wing. The shortened 55 to 65 seat 528 (23.38m (76ft 9in) fuselage length and 15.84m (52ft 0in) cabin length) would have followed the 928. The three types would have featured a high degree of commonality, including engine type, and the same flightdeck, allowing a common pilot type rating. \r\n\r\nFairchild Dornier also launched a corporate jet version of the 728, the Envoy 7, which was foreseen to enter service in 2004. The Envoy 7 had intercontinental range and would be equipped with Fairchild Dornier's \"Super Shark\" winglets. Corporate versions of the 528 and 928, the Envoy 5 and Envoy 9 respectively, were also planned. \r\n\r\nEight customers, among them Lufthansa Cityline, GECAS, Bavaria Leasing, CSA-Czech Airlines, and SolAir, had (by March 2002) placed firm orders for 125 aircraft and signed options for an additional 164.\r\n\r\nHowever, before the first flight of the 728 had been made, Fairchild Dornier filed for insolvency on April 2 2002, and the whole ambitious program came to an end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}, {"relatedLinks": "FFA AS-202 Bravo", "capacity": "Two pilots side by side, plus one passenger in rear.", "dimensions": "Wing span 9.75m (32ft 0in), length 7.50m (24ft 7in), height 2.81m (9ft 3in).

Other changes include more economical RollsRoyce Tay turbofans (which, unlike the F-28's Speys, conform to Stage 3 noise limits), revised wing design with greater span and aerodynamic efficiency (Fokker claimed it to be 30% more efficient than the F-28's), a modern EFIS glass flightdeck, redesigned cabin interior plus other systems and numerous equipment changes. \r\n\r\nThe Fokker 100's first flight occurred on November 30 1986, certification was awarded in November 1987 and the first customer delivery, to Swissair, occurred in February 1988. \r\n\r\nThe Fokker 100 was offered in a number of versions including higher gross weight options of the standard airliner, the Fokker 100QC Quick change airliner or freighter with a large forward freight door and the Fokker Executive Jet 100 corporate shuttle or VIP transport, fitted with luxury interiors to customer requirements.

The Fokker 50 is based on the fuselage of the F-27-500 Friendship, but incorporates a number of key design changes. Foremost of the improvements was the new generation Pratt & Whitney Canada PW125 turboprops driving advanced six blade props, giving a 12% higher cruising speed and greater fuel economy, and thus range. Other improvements include new avionics and an EFIS glass cockpit, limited use of composites, small `Foklet' winglets, and more, squared, main cabin windows. \r\n\r\nTwo prototypes were built based on F-27 airframes (despite the fact that over 80% of Fokker 50 parts are new or modified), the first flying on December 28 1985.

The Fokker 60 was stretched by 1.62m (5ft 4in). \r\n\r\nFokker collapsed due to financial problems on March 15 1996 and the last Fokker 50 was delivered to Ethiopian Airlines in May 1997. \r\n\r\n"}, {"relatedLinks": "Fokker 70", "capacity": "Flightcrew of two.

The Fokker 70's 30.91m (101ft 4in) length is close to that of the F-28-4000's 29.61m (97ft 2in), on which the Fokker 100 was originally based. \r\n\r\nThe first Fokker 70 was in fact the second Fokker 100 prototype which was modified by removing two fuselage plugs - one forward and one rear of the wing. Construction on this aircraft began in October 1992 (before the November 1992 program goahead), resulting in the type's first flight on April 4 1993. The first production Fokker 70 flew for the first time in July 1994 and certification was awarded on October 14 1994. The first Fokker 70 (an Executive Jet 70) was delivered to Ford in the USA later that month. \r\n\r\nA design aim of the Fokker 70 was to retain as much commonality with the larger Fokker 100 as possible. As a result they share essentially identical wings, airframes (except for length, and the removal of two emergency overwing exits on the Fokker 70) and systems, plus similar EFIS flightdecks. The Fokker 70 was offered with two flightdecks, one optimised for the 70's regional airline operations, the other essentially identical to the Fokker 100's to give operators of both types commonality. The Fokker 70 and 100 also share identical Tay Mk.620 powerplants, although the Tay Mk.650 that was offered for the 100 was not available on the 70. The 70 and 100 were built on a common production line. \r\n\r\nAs with the Fokker 100, a corporate shuttle, the Fokker Executive Jet 70, was offered (and attracted a small number of orders). The Fokker 70A was optimised for US carriers, while the Fokker 70ER (announced in late 1994) had extra fuel tankage and extended range. \r\n\r\nWith Fokker's collapse in 1996, the Fokker 70/100 production line closed in early 1997.

However only the four seat tourer, as represented by the prototype, entered production. This aircraft was of conventional low wing and fixed undercarriage design, and was aerobatic at reduced weights. \r\n\r\nThree versions of the FA200 entered production, the first being the 120kW (160hp) powered FA200160, which was also certificated with reduced weights in the Utility category with three seats, and the Aerobatic with two seats. The FA200180 was essentially similar but powered by a 135kW (180hp) fuel injected IO360. Deliveries of both versions began in March 1968. \r\n\r\nA third model joined the lineup from mid 1973, the FA200180AO. This was a reduced specification version of the FA200180 with a fixed pitch propeller and caburetted Lycoming O360 engine. \r\n\r\nThe Aero Subaru remained in production until 1977 when 274 had been built.

The first production Widgeon was the military J4F1, a three seat anti submarine patrol and utility version for the US Navy. The US Navy and US Army Air Force ordered large numbers of Widgeons throughout the war years, others saw service with the US Coast Guard and 15 were supplied to Britain's Royal Navy, that service originally calling the aircraft Gosling. In all, 176 Widgeons were built for military service during the conflict. \r\n\r\nAfter the war, Grumman refined the Widgeon for commercial use by altering the hull profile for improved handling on water and increasing seating capacity for up to six. Grumman built 50 of these as the G-44A, while a further 40 were built in France as the SCAN-30. Most SCAN-30s were delivered to customers in the USA. \r\n\r\nUS firm McKinnon Enterprises offered conversions during the 1960s to both the Grumman Goose and Widgeon.

The first Albatross prototype flew for the first time on October 24 1947, with more than 400 production HU-16s subsequently delivered to the US Navy, US Coast Guard and 12 other nations. Military Albatross missions included general reconnaissance, maritime patrol, anti submarine warfare (in which role it could be armed with torpedoes and depth charges) and search and rescue. \r\n\r\nIn the late 1970s, Grumman and major US flying boat operator Resorts International began work on a program to convert the Albatross for civil airline service. The conversion incorporated numerous changes to the basic Albatross, including a 28 seat passenger interior, a galley and provision for a flight attendant, upgraded avionics and other improved systems. The airframes were also stripped down, inspected, components were replaced or repaired, and the whole airframe was zero timed. Military equipment was removed and the engines were stripped down and rebuilt. The first such G-111 Albatross conversion flew for the first time on February 13 1979 and US FAA certification was awarded in April 1980. \r\n\r\nGrumman purchased 57 Albatrosses for conversion and foresaw a potential market for up to 200 modified amphibians, however this prediction proved somewhat optimistic. In all only 13 aircraft were converted, 12 for Resorts International, and 1 for Conoco Oil/Pelita which operated from Singapore. Several of these are still active, together with ex military examples.  \r\n\r\nA more developed version powered by Garrett TPE-331 turboprops and a firebomber were also studied but not developed. Later in 1986 Frakes International proposed reengining Albatrosses with Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A or PW-120 turboprops, but this plan also was not pursued.

From July 1 1963 the separate identities disappeared. \r\n\r\nThe new aircraft made a successful maiden flight on June 24 1960, and four prototype aircraft (two for static testing) were built. The first production Series 1 flew on August 30 1961. \r\n\r\nSeries 1 production aircraft were powered by two 1400kW (1880ehp) Dart RDa.6 Mk 514 turboprops, and the first entered service in December 1961 with Skyways Airways.

The Series 2 differed from the 1 in having higher weights and more powerful engines. The Series 2B appeared in 1977, offering a range of aerodynamic and other improvements, including an increased wing span. Many Series 2A and 2B were equipped with a large forward fuselage freight door. \r\n\r\nThe most advanced 748 variant, the Super 748, was an improved version of the 2B and made its first flight in July 1984. Incorporating the improvements of the 2B, it also featured a modernised flightdeck, improved efficiency and hushkitted Dart engines, and new galley and internal fittings. \r\n\r\nHawker Siddeley, where the 748 was known as the HS-748, was merged into British Aerospace and from January 1 1978 the Hawker Siddeley name disappeared. Production of the aircraft type, now the BAe-748, ended in 1988 with the last flying that December (with delivery the following month).\r\n\r\nThe Indian Ministry of Defence had expressed an early interest in the 748 which resulted in an agreemnet to assemble and build the aircraft under licence. The first four aircraft, Series 1, were built by Kanpur (Indian Air Force Manufacturing Depot), with the first flight made on November 1 1961. Due to a poor production rate, the production was taken over from the fifth aircraft by Hindustan as the HAL-748, who first produced the Series 2 and later the Series 2M with the front fuselage freight door.

In its first form it was powered by a 197kW (264hp) Lycoming GO435 and seated four. First flight occurred during 1953 and deliveries of the initial production model, the H391B, got underway in 1954. Subsequent development led to a number of derivatives, beginning with the H392 Strato Courier of 1957.

Large numbers of military Hillers were also built for the US military as H23 Ravens. \r\n\r\nThe production history of the UH12 is chequered, with design and initial production undertaken by the original Hiller company. Hiller, and then Fairchild Hiller, built over 2000 up until the late 1960s. The newly formed Hiller Aviation acquired design and production rights in 1973 and restarted UH12E production. Hiller Aviation was then acquired by Rogerson Aircraft in 1984, the first UH12Es manufactured under the new company banner coming off the line in mid 1984. Rogerson subsequently changed its name to Rogerson Hiller, and relaunched UH12E production in 1991. \r\n\r\nThe final chapter of the UH12 story thus far opened in mid 1994 when the original designer and owner Stanley Hiller, in conjunction with Thai investors, acquired the program from Rogerson. The new Hiller Aircraft Corporation is building small numbers of UH12E3s (the first flew on June 2 1995) for its Thai partners, and has also flown the Allison 250 turboprop powered UH-12E3T. \r\n\r\n"}, {"relatedLinks": "Hindustan Advanced Light Helicopter", "capacity": "Flightcrew of two.

In 1986 Honda began research into compact business jets, using engines from other manufacturers. However, details of this research have never been revealed. From 1999 Honda developed its own turbofan jet engine, the HF-118, which was testflown on a Cessna Citation. This engine features a single fan, a two-stage compressor and a two-stage turbine. The wing shape of the future HondaJet was tested on a Lockheed T-33. \r\n\r\nThe HA-420 HondaJet made its first flight on December 3 2003. The aircraft will undergo about 200 hours of flight testing to verify its flying characteristics and performance. \r\n\r\nA prominent feature of the HondaJet is the over-the-wing engine configuration. Because no carry-through structure is needed in the aft fuselage for the engine mounts, this allows for a full-width cabin farther aft gaining 30% extra space within the same dimensions. Honda also claims that this configuration reduces drag at higher speeds.   \r\n\r\nThe fuselage is made of composite material, a lightweight co-cured carbon composite/honeycomb sandwich, while the wings are made of integrally stiffened skin panels formed from single sheets of aluminum, offering a smoother surface than conventional configurations. The wing uses Honda's proprietary turbulence reducing laminar SMH-1 airfoil, which is rather thick but offers low drag at high speed. Also the nose is designed to generate laminar flow to reduce drag. Honda claims that these features, together with the fuel-efficient HF-118 engines, achieve a 40% higher fuel efficiency. The aircraft is equipped with a Garmin G-1000 glass cockpit with three displays and an integrated avionics system. Four passengers can be accomodated with two crew, or five passengers with a single pilot.\r\n\r\nHonda has not yet revealed if and when the HondaJet will be taken into production, but late 2003 there were rumours that Honda is investigating the possibilities to take over an existing US company to facilitate the production of the aircraft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  "}, {"relatedLinks": "IAI Arava", "capacity": "Flightcrew of two.

Ilyushin responded with a low wing tricycle undercarriage design powered by two Shvetsov radials with maximum seating for 27. This aircraft was designated the Il-12. \r\n\r\nThe Il-14 is an improved development of the basic Il-12 design. The major improvement Ilyushin introduced was a new wing design featuring a more efficient aerofoil section, plus more powerful Shvetsov engines and a general clean up of the airframe. \r\n\r\nGiven the NATO reporting name \"Crate\", the Il-14 is believed to have entered service in 1954 or 1955.

Approximately two years after entry into service most Il-14Ps were configured to seat 24 passengers in a higher density configuration. By 1956 a slightly stretched development, the Il-14M (Modifitsirovanny/modified), had appeared. Initially the Il-14M was configured to seat 24, but this was later changed to 36.

The prototype Il-18 (named Moskva) was powered by four 2985kW (4000shp) Kuznetsov SN4 turboprops and flew for the first time on July 4 1957. The first Il-18 entered Aeroflot service on April 20 1959. \r\n\r\nInitial production Il-18s could seat 75 passengers and were powered by the Kuznetsov engines, but only the first 20 aircraft built were so powered before the 2985kW (4000shp) Ivchenko AI20 became the standard powerplant. From there on only minor changes characterised the Il-18's development life. \r\n\r\nThe first new production model was the Il-18B which had a reconfigured interior to seat 84 passengers. The Il-18V entered service in 1961. It became the standard Aeroflot version and could seat 90 to 100 passengers, depending on configuration. The Il-18I introduced more powerful 3170kW (4250ehp) AI20Ms, while seating could be increased to 122 in summer with the deletion of the rear coat closet (essential in Russian winters) and fitting extra seats. The Il-18D is similar to the I but has extra fuel capacity with an additional centre section tank. On the Il-18D and Il-18I the APU is in the belly of the fuselage, rather than in the tail. \r\n\r\nThe Il-18 has the NATO reporting name of `Coot'. Like the Lockheed Electra, the Il-18 also formed the basis of a maritime patrol and anti submarine warfare aircraft, the Il38 `May'. \r\n\r\nMost Il-18s are now flown by secondary operators on regional routes and on charters as they have been replaced by more modern and efficient jet equipment on primary routes. \r\n\r\n"}, {"relatedLinks": "Ilyushin Il-62", "capacity": "Flightcrew of five comprising two pilots, flight engineer, navigator and radio operator.

But a protracted development program followed and the first examples did not enter service until almost a decade later in late 1980. Antonov, Tupolev and Ilyushin were all asked to respond to Aeroflot's requirement for a widebody airliner, with Ilyushin's design proving successful. \r\n\r\nThe Il-86 initially was similar in configuration to the narrowbody Il-62, with four rear mounted turbofans and a Ttail. However the same problems that affects most Ttail designs such as poor low speed handling, plus the heavy structural weight needed to support the four engines caused a rethink, resulting in the adoption of a conventional tail and under wing mounted engine configuration. \r\n\r\nAlthough a conventional design, one unusual feature of the Il-86 is that - where airport aerobridges are not provided - passengers can board the aircraft via airstairs leading to a lower deck baggage stowage area, before climbing a fixed internal staircase to the main passenger cabin. \r\n\r\nThe Il-86 was first unveiled in prototype form in 1976. The first of two prototypes flew for the first time on December 22 1976, while the first production aircraft flew on October 24 1977. Airline service began in December 1980 (Aeroflot had previously hoped to have it in service in time for the 1980 Moscow Olympic Games).

It is now part of the expanded Gulfstream stable, designated G100. \r\n\r\nIsrael Aircraft Industries began work on an improved development of its model 1124, initially known as the 1125 Westwind, in the early 1980s, with the first flight of the new type occurring on March 19 1984. A second prototype flew in October 1984, and a third was used for ground based static and fatigue testing. The first production Astra flew in March 1985, and the first customer delivery took place in mid 1986 after certification had been granted in August the previous year. \r\n\r\nThe Astra is based on the basic Westwind II fuselage and tail, mated with an all new high speed swept wing (initially lacking winglets). Aside from the aerodynamic and hence performance benefits of the new wing, it was also repositioned low on the fuselage (as opposed to mid mounted on the Westwind), where it does not intrude on internal cabin space. The repositioned wing plus reshaped fuselage frames means that headroom is increased by 20cm (8in). Other changes include a lengthened nose for greater avionics space and more extensive use of composites (mainly for control surfaces). \r\n\r\nThe original 1125 Astra was replaced in production by the Astra SP. The SP was first announced in 1989 and features a revised cabin interior, upgraded avionics, EFIS cockpit and some minor aerodynamic refinements. Thirty seven were built before it was replaced by the SPX. \r\n\r\nThe SPX, renamed G100 from September 2002, first flew in August 1994. It features more powerful FADEC equipped 18.9kN (4250lb) Honeywell TFE731-40R-200Gs, winglets and Collins Pro Line 4 avionics. \r\n\r\nIAI builds the G100 in Israel and the \"green\" airframes are flown to Lincoln, Nebraska in the US for interior outfitting. Gulfstream acquired Galaxy Aerospace, which held the Astra type certificates and was responsible for marketing, in May 2001.\r\n\r\nIn September 2002 Gulfstream announced the improved G150, based on the G100 but with an enlarged fuselage and seating for six to eight. It will be powered by TFE731s, cruise at Mach 0.75 and have a range of 5000km (2700nm). Deliveries are due in 2005.  \r\n\r\nTwo Astra SPXs have been delivered to the US Air Force (Air National Guard) as C-38As for transport and medevac tasks. \r\n"}, {"relatedLinks": "Israel IAI-1126 Galaxy/Gulfstream G200", "capacity": "Flightcrew of two.

In 1995 a co-production arrangement was terminated that would have seen Yakovlev in Russia responsible for the design and manufacture of the Galaxy's fuselage, while IAI would be the main contractor responsible for final assembly, integration and marketing. Subsequently SOGERMA of France was selected to manufacture production Galaxy fuselages and tails. \r\n\r\nThe Galaxy was first expected to fly in 1996 but this was delayed until December 25 1997. A second prototype flew in May 1998 while the first production aircraft first flew in October that year. US FAA and Israeli certification was issued in December 1998. The first customer aircraft was delivered to TTI Industries in January 2000 (a Galaxy delivered to Lion Industries in Zurich in July 1999 was leased back by Galaxy Aerospace for use as a demonstrator). \r\n\r\nIAI assembles and test flies Galaxies in Israel while interior completion takes place at Galaxy Aerospace's new facilities in Fort Worth, Texas. \r\n\r\nThe Galaxy features a wing design based on the swept high speed unit of the Astra, but otherwise is a completely new design. It features a new \"widebody\" fuselage, significantly wider and longer than the Astra's, with standup room. The rear fuselage is area ruled to reduce drag, while the wing features winglets. The Galaxy also features an EFIS Collins Pro Line 4 cockpit and nonstop trans Atlantic and one stop trans Pacific range. \r\n\r\nIAI selected the Pratt & Whitney Canada PW-306A turbofans for the Galaxy in January 1993 after studying competing designs from Allison (the AE-3007) and AlliedSignal/General Electric (the CFE-738). The PW-306A is a growth development (with increased fan diameter, improved hot end material and a forced mixer in the exhaust) of the PW-305 series that powers the Hawker 1000 and Learjet 60. \r\n\r\nIn June 2001, Galaxy Aerospace was acquired by Gulfstream Aerospace, who now owns the type certificate and is responsible for further development and engineering support. The Galaxy was renamed Gulfstream G200 at the same time. Israel Aircraft Industries continues to build and test fly the aircraft in Israel at its Tel Aviv facilities, which are then flown \"green\" to Gulfstream's completion center at Dallas Love Field airport in Texas, where interiors and optional equipment are installed (before Gulfstream's acquisition of the project, Galaxy Aerospace undertook completions and deliveries from a new facility at Alliance Airport, Fort Worth, Texas). \r\n\r\nSome orders announced by Gulfstream: 50 plus an option on another 50 for Executive Jets, 24 plus an option on 43 for Avolar, and 3 for Hainan Airlines.  \r\n\r\n"}, {"relatedLinks": "Kaman K-1200 K-Max", "capacity": "Accommodates pilot only but certificated with fuselage side mounted external seats (one either side).

The two main rotors have the dual advantages of allowing a low rotor disc area loading and that all the engine's power produces lift, and none is \"wasted\" driving an anti torque tail rotor. The two main rotors are also fitted with trailing edge servo flaps that control the blades' angle of attack, negating the need for hydraulic power. \r\n\r\nPower is supplied by a Honeywell (formerly AlliedSignal and Lycoming) T53-17A-1 turboshaft (equivalent to the military T53-L-703), the T53 also powers the Bell UH-1 Iroquois series (and the equivalent commercial Bell 204 and 205, described separately). The extremely high power to weight ratio of the K-Max means it can lift loads of up to 2720kg (6000lb). \r\n\r\nThe prototype K-Max first flew on December 23 1991, piloted by company test pilot Al Ashley. Certification was delayed somewhat by an early decision to improve the rotor system to increase performance margins, changes including lengthening the main rotors' diameters and increasing the rating of the transmission. US FAA certification was awarded in September 1994. \r\n\r\nRecognising that the K-Max's high power to weight ratio may place inexperienced operators in difficult situations, Kaman took a very cautious approach to marketing the aircraft and leased out the first six production aircraft while flight experience was gained. \r\n\r\nAs an aerial crane the K-Max is suited to firefighting operations carrying various size Bambi buckets, logging, construction, surveying and aerial spraying.

An aerodynamic prototype of the design began test flying in July 1996 while the first certification prototype first flew in early 1997. The type's first public appearance was at the 1997 Oshkosh Airshow as the LC-40 Columbia 300. Certification was awarded on October 1 1998. Deliveries of production aircraft (built at a new factory at Redmond's Bend Municipal Airport) began in February 2000. \r\n\r\nIn common with Lancair's kitplanes, the Columbia 300 features composite construction allowing a smooth, low drag external finish. Power is from a six cylinder 225kW (300hp) Continental IO-550. The 300 features a 402 litre (106US gal/82Imp gal) fuel capacity in two tanks, advanced IFR avionics and fixed undercarriage.\r\n\r\nLancair announced the even quicker turbocharged Columbia 400 in early 2000.

First flight was in June 2000. The Columbia 400 will take the mantle of the world's fastest production fixed undercarriage light aircraft from the Columbia 300.\r\n\r\nThe 400 will also introduce Lancair's HITS (Highway in the Sky) advanced IFR avionics platform, designed with AvroTec (displays), Avidyne (software) and Seagull, under sponsorship of NASA's AGATE program, for improved IFR situational awareness. HITS features a primary flight display that presents flight data in an integrated format, and a multifunction display for moving map displays, StormScope, radar, up-linked weather and traffic avoidance programs. Another advanced feature to be introduced with the 400 will be a FADEC (Full Authority Digital Engine Controls) engine management system, allowing single lever control for power, mixture and the propeller. FADEC uses sophisticated microcomputers to monitor and adjust the operation of each engine cylinder several times each second, which has many benefits in economy, pilot comfort, and performance. HITS and FADEC will be offered as options on the 300 in 2001.\r\n\r\nOn April 5, 2002 Lancair announced a new model, the Columbia 350.

Lear had formed the Swiss-American Aviation Corporation (SAAC) in 1960 to manufacture a twin-jet high-speed executive aircraft, the SAAC-23. This aircraft was designed and conceived by Dr.eng. Hans-Luzius Studer, who previously had developed the FFA P-16 fighter. The aerodynamics and many other characteristics of the 23 were taken over from the P-16. Although it was originally planned to manufacture at least the first 25 Lear Jets in Switzerland, production was transferred to the United States, where Lear had founded Lear Jet Corporation. \r\n\r\nThe diminutive Model 23 pioneered an entirely new market segment for the light business jets, and proved very successful. The first production 23 was delivered in October 1964, but was replaced by the improved Model 24 in 1966 after 105 had been built. The 24, which introduced uprated engines and a number of detail changes, first flew in February 1966 and was delivered from the middle of that year. Developments of the 24 included the 24D, E and F, introducing improvements such as increased weights, thrusts, and range. \r\n\r\nThe Learjet 25 introduced a 1.27m (4ft 2in) fuselage stretch allowing seating for up to eight passengers and was first flown on August 12 1966, and, like the 24, a number of subsequent developments were built, including the B, C, and D.\r\n\r\nIn 1966 the name of the manufacturer changed to Lear Jet Industries, and in January 1970 Gates Rubber Company, who had bought a controlling interest, changed the name again, to Gates Learjet Corporation.\r\n\r\nThe unsuccessful Gates Learjet 28 and 29 Longhorns are based on the 25 but introduced a new increased span wing fitted with winglets, which improved fuel efficiency and overall performance, particularly payload range and fuel economy. The Longhorn 28 seats up to eight passengers, the similar dimensions Longhorn 29 sacrifices two seats for extra range. Production of the family ceased in 1982.\r\n\r\nLearjets are known for their tight accomodation.

The Learjet 35 has seating for up to eight, but has less fuel than the longer range 36, which can only seat up to six, as both types share the same maximum takeoff weight. The 35 and 36 were certificated in July 1974. \r\n\r\nImprovements to the two models led to the 35A and 36A from 1976, with higher standard max takeoff weights. Both models remained in production until 1994. \r\n\r\nDevelopment of the 35 and 36 range was taken one step further with the Learjet 31, which combines the 35/36's fuselage and powerplants with the more modern wing of the 55 (now also on the 60) and delta fins under the tail. A 31 development aircraft first flew in May 1987 and certification was awarded in August 1988. \r\n\r\nThe improved 31A and 31A/ER are later production models, the 31A/ER being an extended range variant with a higher maximum takeoff weight and more fuel. A new interior with increased headroom was introduced in 1995.

His resulting design is similar in many ways to its contemporary western twins, with a four or five place cabin, a low wing, wingtip tanks, metal construction and retractable undercarriage. However the Morava is distinguishable by its twin tails, standard thermal wing deicing equipment and inverted inline engines. \r\n\r\nThe prototype XL-200 Morava flew for the first time on April 8 1957. The XL-200 prototype and a series of preproduction L-200s were powered by 120kW (160hp) Walter Minor 6-III inline sixes. Initial production was of the L-200A, which differed from the L-200 in being powered by two 155kW (210hp) fuel injected M-337s, and had greater weights, a reprofiled cabin and hydraulically (rather than electrically) operated undercarriage and flaps. \r\n\r\nLet built 160 L-200As before production switched to the improved L-200D. Features include a strengthened undercarriage, improved hydraulic and electrical systems and constant speed three blade propellers. The L-200D remained in production until 1969, and 5 aircraft were licence built in Slovenia (then part of Yugoslavia) by Libis. A turboprop powered development was studied but not built. \r\n\r\nMost L-200 production was for customers within the Soviet Bloc - Aeroflot for example operated a large number in a range of roles including air taxi, air ambulance and communications duties.

This resulted in the C-130 Hercules, which first flew in prototype form on August 23 1954. Design features included the high mounted wing, four Allison 501/T56 turboprops and the rear loading freight ramp. The USAF ordered the C-130 into series production in September 1952, and since that time more than 2500 have been built. \r\n\r\nThe C-130's appeal to freight operators led Lockheed to develop a civil version. The first commercial versions were based on the C-130E model, and a demilitarised demonstrator first flew in April 1964. This initial civil development, the L-100 (L-382), was awarded civil certification in February 1965. This model was soon followed up by the series L-100 (L-382B), which introduced an improved freight handling system. \r\n\r\nSales of these initial versions were slow, leading Lockheed to develop the 2.54m (8ft 4in) stretched L-100-20 (L-382E), which offered better freight capacity and operating economics. The L-100-20 was certificated in October 1968, but was soon followed by the even longer L-100-30 (L-382G). The -30 was 2.03m (6ft 8in) longer than the -20, first flew in August 1970, and was delivered from December that year. Most civil Hercules sales have been of the L-100-30 variant. Although basically a civil aircraft, several L-100s are in service with military operators, e.g. in Algeria, Gabon and Kuwait. The last L-100 was built in 1992, while the last military Allison 501/T56 powered C-130 was delivered in 1996. \r\n\r\nThe L-100J would be a commercial derivative of the new generation C-130J Hercules II. Improvements would include new 3425kW (4591shp) Rolls-Royce (Allison) AE-2100D3 advanced turboprop engines driving six blade props, two crew EFIS flightdeck and significantly lower maintenance and operating costs. The C-130J first flew on April 5 1996, while US FAA civil certification was awarded in September 1998. The L-100J would be based on the stretched fuselage C-130J-30, but in 2000 the program was frozen as Lockheed martin focussed on the military variants. \r\n\r\n"}, {"relatedLinks": "Lockheed L-1011 TriStar 1/50/100/150/200/250", "capacity": "Flightcrew of three.

Lockheed initially studied a twin engined layout, but it was decided that three engines would be necessary to ensure it could takeoff at max weights from existing runways. \r\n\r\nWork on the L-1011 prototype began early in 1969, resulting in a November 16 1970 first flight. The engine choice of Rolls-Royce's advanced three shaft design RB211 however dogged the TriStar's early career. Rolls-Royce went bankrupt in February 1970 largely due to higher than estimated RB211 development costs, severely harming both Lockheed and the TriStar sales program. The problems were able to be resolved after the British government nationalised Rolls-Royce, guaranteeing the supply of production engines. Despite the initial problems the RB211 proved to be extremely reliable and efficient in service and grew into a family of variants. \r\n\r\nThe first L-1011 model that entered service with Eastern and TWA in April 1972 was the initial domestic L-1011-1 (which was built in greater numbers than any other TriStar variant). Subsequent models to be developed were the -100 with more fuel and higher weights, the -200 with higher thrust engines, and the long range shorter fuselage -500, described separately.\r\n\r\nProduction ceased in 1983, when 250 had been built. The prototype was sold to be broken up for spares in 1986. \r\n\r\nMany aircraft were converted to improved models: the -50 with a higher MTOW and strengthened fuselage, wings, and undercarriage, the -150 with a higher MTOW, the -250 with RB211-524B4 engines (as on the 500) for US carrier Delta, a small number to freighters with a large cargo door as -1(F) and -200(F), and quite a few to -100 and -200.\r\n\r\nAn ex Air Canada TriStar 100 was converted in 1992 by Marshall of Cambridge (Engineering) Ltd for Orbital Sciences Corporation as the \"Stargazer\" flying satellite launcher. After launching the Pegasus Air-Launched Space Booster from the TriStar, the Pegasus itself launched a satellite into low Earth orbit.  \r\n\r\nAnother TriStar 100, ex Worldways Canada, was converted in 1995/1996 by Lockheed Aeromod Center to a flying hospital for Operation Blessing International Relief & Development Corporation, a non-profit humanitarian organisation. Apart from the hospital equipment, the aircraft is fitted with systems to be independent from local ground-based equipment.    \r\n\r\nApproximately 156 TriStars remained in service in 1998, of which 122 were standard fuselage models. In 2000 this number had gone down to about 137, of which 109 standard fuselage models, and at the end of 2002 this had further dropped to 51 active TriStars, of which 23 standard fuselage ones. \r\n\r\n"}, {"relatedLinks": "Lockheed L-1011 TriStar 500", "capacity": "Flightcrew of three.

The shortened fuselage reduces seating capacity to a maximum of 330, 70 less than the standard length TriStars, while the below deck galleys that had been a feature of the L-1011 family were replaced with conventional main deck units. \r\n\r\nOther improvements include enhanced wing-to-fuselage and fuselage-to-rear engine intake fairings, automatic braking and automatic thrust control. Most have three, rather than four, doors/emergency exits on each side of the fuselage. The design changes combine to give the 500 a maximum range of 11,260km (6100nm), approximately 2000km (1300nm) further than the long range 200.\r\n\r\nThe TriStar 500 first flew on October 16 1978 and entered service with British Airways in May 1979. \r\n\r\nSoon after, the 500 also introduced the active aileron improvements first pioneered on the Advanced TriStar, which was the original prototype TriStar fitted with a number of advanced features intended for introduction to the TriStar production line. The Advanced TriStar incorporated increased span wings to reduce drag, with active, automatic operation of the ailerons used to cope with the increased weight and aerodynamic loads instead of strengthening the wing structure. \r\n\r\nThe first 500 with active ailerons and extended wingtips flew in November 1979 and deliveries of 500s with the new wing tip extension began the following year, while in 1981 it became a standard feature. Lockheed began retrofitting the active aileron wingtip extension to all previously built TriStar 500s from 1981. Production ceased in 1983 after 50 had been built, although the last 500 was not delivered until 1985. \r\n\r\nIn December 1982 Britain's Royal Air Force bought 6 TriStar 500s from British Airways and contracted Marshall of Cambridge (Engineering) Ltd for the conversions. Four of them were converted to tanker-transports as TriStar K1. The conversion involves the installation of paired HDUs (Hose Drum Units) in the lower rear fuselage, underfloor fuel tanks in the fore and aft baggage compartments, adding an additional 100,060lbs (45,385kg) of fuel, a closed circuit TV camera to monitor refuelling, and military communications and navigation equipment. The aircraft are also equipped with a refuelling probe above the forward fuselage. \r\n\r\nThe first flight was made on July 9, 1985. As full passenger seating is available in the cabin, the K1 is an excellent aircraft for squadron deployments, able to refuel their aircraft in the air and at the same time carrying squadron personnel and supplies.\r\n\r\nThe other two aircraft, and two of the K1s, were converted to TriStar KC1 with the same modifications as the K1 but with an additional large cargo door in the port side front fuselage, a freight handling system, and a strengthened floor. They can carry cargo on pallets and 35 passengers. The first KC1 was flown in 1988.\r\n\r\nThree more, ex Pan Am, TriStar 500s were bought in 1984, two of them serving as troop transport TriStar C2s. They retain the normal passenger seating and are not equipped with a flight refuelling probe. It was planned to convert the third one to a tanker K2, but these plans were abandoned and it was delivered instead as a TriStar C2A, with a new interior, military avionics, and the digital autopilot replaced by the same analog autopilot as fitted to the K1 and KC1. The MTOW for all RAF TriStars was increased to 540,000lbs (244,945kg). They serve with 216 Squadron. \r\n\r\nIn late 2002 28 of the 50 TriStar 500s built were in active service, 16 in airline service, 3 as corporate transport, and 9 in RAF military service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}, {"relatedLinks": "Lockheed L-188 Electra", "capacity": "Flightcrew of three.

Today it remains popular with freight operators. \r\n\r\nThe Lockheed L-188 Electra was developed to meet a 1954 American Airlines requirement for a domestic short to medium range 75 to 100 seat airliner. In June 1955 American awarded Lockheed an order for 35 such aircraft. Lockheed's design, the L-188, was a low wing, four turboprop powered aircraft. Many other airlines shared American's interest in the L-188, and by the time the first prototype flew on December 6 1957, the order book stood at 144. Service entry was with Eastern Airlines (due to a pilot's strike at American) on January 12 1959. \r\n\r\nHowever, any optimism Lockheed felt about a strong sales future would have been short lived, as a number of crashes in 1959 and 1960 (two of which where the aircraft broke up in flight) contributed to a number of order cancellations. \r\n\r\nAs an interim measure following the crashes, speed restrictions were imposed on Electras. Investigations uncovered a design defect with the engine mountings where the wing would shake and eventually break up. Lockheed undertook a significant modification program where the nacelles, nacelle mountings and wing structure were strengthened, and the speed restrictions were eventually lifted in 1961. After that the Electra proved reliable and popular in service, but the damage had been done and production wound up in 1961 after 170 had been built.\r\n\r\nLockheed built two basic versions of the Electra. The L-188A was the basic production aircraft, and accounted for most Electra sales. The L-188C entered service with KLM in 1959 and had greater fuel capacity and higher weights, and thus improved payload range performance. \r\n\r\nThe Electra also forms the basis for the hugely successful P-3 Orion long range maritime surveillance aircraft of which more than 600 have been built. \r\n\r\nMost Electras currently in service are configured as freighters. From 1967 Lockheed converted 41 Electras to freighters or convertible freighter/passenger aircraft, fitting a strengthened floor and a large cargo door forward of the wing on the left side.

The initial M-4 Bee Dee, or later M-4C Jetasen, was quite basic, featuring a 108kW (145hp) O-300 and fixed pitch prop; other M-4 variants were the 155kW (210hp) Continental IO-360 powered M-4-210C Rocket and the 118kW (220hp) Franklin 6A-350 powered M-4-220C Strata Rocket. \r\n\r\nThe M-5 series went into production in 1973 and featured a large swept back vertical tail surface, four cabin doors, optional extra fuel and the cambered wingtips first introduced on later series M-4s. Variants included the Franklin powered M-5-220C and Lycoming O-540 powered M-5-225C Lunar Rockets; the Continental powered M-5-210C and M-5-180C (with a four cylinder O-360); and the turbocharged Lycoming TIO-360 powered M-5-210TC. \r\n\r\nThe M-6 was only built in small numbers but introduced changes such as greater wing span and fuel tankage. \r\n\r\nMaule Aircraft Production ceased in 1975, while Maule Air Inc was formed in 1984 to build the M-5 and improved M-7 \r\n\r\nThe M-7 forms the basis of a prolific family of subvariants.

Launched in October 1977, the Super 80 first flew on October 18 1979. Certification for the initial Super 80 model, the 81, was granted in July 1981.

In December 1997 Boeing announced its decision to drop the MD-80 and MD-90 once current orders were fulfilled.

By then Hughes was already working on a civil variant, to be marketed as the Hughes 500. However, the engineering and certification designation for all military and civil variants of this helicopter type is Hughes Model 369. It was offered in basic five and seven seat configurations, and a 500U utility version. The 500 and 500U were powered by an Allison 250-C18A engine. \r\n\r\nIn 1970 the 500C followed with a more powerful 250-C20 turboshaft. From 1976 deliveries were of the 500D, an improved version with again a more powerful engine, the 250-C20B, a T-tail, and new five blade main and optional four blade tail rotors. The 500D was followed by the 500E from 1982 with recontoured nose and various interior improvements including greater head and leg room. The 530F (first delivery January 1984) is a more powerful version optimised for hot and high work. \r\n\r\nMcDonnell Douglas acquired Hughes Helicopters in January 1984, and in August 1985 the Hughes name disappeared. From then on the 500E and 530F were built as the MD-500E and MD-530F Lifter. After the 1997 merger with Boeing, the line was up for sale. Bell's plans to acquire the Boeing civil helicopter lines were thwarted by the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 1998. Then in January 1999 Boeing announced the sale of the light helicopter lines to MD Helicopters, a newly formed division of Netherlands based RDM Holdings. The sale was finalised in february 1999.

In December 1981 Hughes flew an OH-6A fitted with NOTAR for the first time. This prototype was modified several times, notably in 1985 when it was fitted with the more streamlined MD-500E forward fuselage, an Allison 250-C20B turboshaft, a second blowing slot and a new fan. By then Hughes had become McDonnell Douglas.\r\n\r\nAlthough the concept, which uses the Coanda effect, took some time to refine, the NOTAR system is simple in theory and works to provide directional control the same way a wing develops lift. Low pressure air is forced through two slots on the right side of the tailboom, causing the downwash from the main rotor to hug the tailboom, producing lift, and thus a measure of directional control. This is augmented by a direct jet thruster and vertical stabilisers.\r\n\r\nNOTAR system benefits include far lower external noise (the MD-520N is the quietest certificated helicopter in the world), increased safety due to the lack of a tail rotor, improved handling and performance, reduced vibration and easier maintainability.\r\n\r\nMcDonnell Douglas originally intended to develop the standard MD-520N alongside the more powerful hot and high optimised MD-530N (both were launched in January 1989 and were based on the conventional MD-500E). The MD-530N was the first to fly, on December 29 1989, the MD-520N first flew on May 1 1990. Development of the MD-530N was suspended when McDonnell Douglas decided that the MD-520N met most customer requirements for the 530N. Certification for the MD-520N was awarded on September 13 1991, and the first was delivered on December 31 that year.\r\n \r\n\r\nFollowing the 1997 Boeing/McDonnell Douglas merger, Boeing sold the former MD civil helicopter lines to MD Helicopters in early 1999.\r\n\r\nAt the 2000 Farnborough Airshow MD Helicopters announced enhancements to the MD-520N including an improved Rolls-Royce 250-C20R+ engine with 3-5% more power for better performance on warm days, and, with changes to the diffuser and fan rigging, increased range and payload capability. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}, {"relatedLinks": "MD Helicopters MD-600N", "capacity": "Typical seating for eight, with pilot and passenger on bucket seats, and two bench seats for three people each in the main cabin.", "dimensions": "Rotor diameter 8.38m (27ft 6in), length overall rotor turning 11.79m (35ft 5in), fuselage length 8.99m (29ft 6in), height to top of rotor head 2.65m (8ft 9in), or 2.74m (9ft 0in) with extended skids.

This prototype, a modified MD-530F, had made its first flight on November 22 1994. The MD-630N created high levels of interest at the Heli Expo and McDonnell Douglas gave the go-ahead for the production aircraft, redesignated the MD-600N, in March 1995. \r\n\r\nThe prototype was modified to MD-600N standard with a production standard engine and tail boom and flew in November 1995, followed the next month by the first MD-600N production prototype. Unfortunately this second prototype was destroyed by fire following a forced landing in May 1996, caused by the main rotor contacting the tail boom during extreme control reversal tests. \r\n\r\nThus the third prototype, which first flew on August 9 1996, featured modifications to increase the main rotor-tail boom clearance.

Millicer received a favourable response to its plans to reintroduce the Aircruiser to production but at the same time realised that there existed even greater demand for the two seat Airtourer. In December 1997, following protracted negotiations, Millicer acquired the design rights to the Airtourer from the Airtourer Cooperative (who had earlier purchased the design from New Zealand Aerospace Industries) and since then has focused its primary efforts on improving the basic aircraft and returning it to production. Work on the AirCruiser (the Shrike name was dropped) continues at a slower pace. <p>Millicer is developing two basic AirTourer models, the basic M10-140 and the higher performance M10-160. The M10-140 is powered by a 105kW (140hp) Textron Lycoming O-320 (derated from 110kW/150hp, reducing noise), driving a two blade fixed pitch propeller, while the M10-160 features a 120kW (160hp) fuel injected IO-320 driving a constant speed propeller. <p>The new AirTourers feature substantial changes over their predecessors.

Designed as a light twin turboprop transport suitable for a variety of civil and military roles, the MU-2 first flew on September 14 1963. This first MU-2 and the handful of MU-2As built were powered by Turbom\u00e9ca Astazou turboprops, all other models from the MU-2B onwards had Garrett TPE331s. \r\n\r\nThe MU-2 lineup can be divided up into two basic types, the standard fuselage and stretched fuselage models. The MU-2B, E, F, K, M, P and Solitaire feature the short fuselage, the others, including the Marquise, the stretched fuselage. The first stretched fuselage MU-2G flew on January 10 1969. \r\n\r\nThe MU-2 was progressively improved and upgraded throughout its production life. Notable changes include improved and more powerful TPE331 engines, and four blade propellers from the N and P models. \r\n\r\nMitsubishi established a production facility for MU-2s in San Angelo, Texas in the USA in 1967 to build MU-2s for the North American and world markets. The San Angelo Mitsubishi International facility became the sole source of MU-2 production until 1986 when the line finally closed. \r\n\r\nMitsubishi certificated all the civil TPE331 powered MU-2s as variants of the MU-2B and they were thus given the MU-2B type number followed by a number. However, these MU-2s were also given a separate marketing designation with a sequential suffix letter. The MU-2B-10 is e.g. the MU-2D, and the MU-2B-36A is the MU-2N.\r\n\r\nFour MU-2Cs and 16 MU-2Ks were delivered to the Japanese Army as LR-1s for the liaison and photo reconnaissance role, while 29 MU-2Es were delivered two the Japanese Air Force as search-and-rescue MU-2Ss, equipped with an extended \"thimble\" nose radome, increased fuel capacity, bulged observation windows, and a sliding entry door for dropping rafts.   \r\n  \r\nIn 2000 over 500 MU-2s were in use as corporate transports (mainly in the USA), while many have been converted as freighters. \r\n\r\n"}, {"relatedLinks": "Mooney M-20 to M-20G", "capacity": "Typical seating for four.", "dimensions": "M-20C/E - Wing span 10.67m (35ft 0in), length 7.06m (23ft 2in), height 2.54m (8ft 4in).

The first product of the new Mooney Aircraft Corporation was the 1948 wooden single seat M-18 Mite. But he wished to extend his ideas for efficient, affordable aircraft to a larger, four seat design of metal and wood construction with fabric covering. \r\n\r\nThis was the Mooney M-20 which first flew on August 10 1953. The M-20 was powered by a 105kW (145hp) six cylinder Continental O-300 flat six engine, had retractable undercarriage and introduced the distinctive forward swept tail. It was placed into production soon after with a 110kW (150hp) Lycoming O-320, and a prolific series of developments followed. \r\n\r\nThese included the 700 plus M-20As with a 135kW (180hp) O-360, and the similarly powered M-20C Mark 21. Very successful with 400 built in its first year, the Mark 21 featured an all metal structure and higher takeoff weight. A lower spec fixed undercarriage version, the M-20D Master was also offered. The subsequent M-20E Super 21 flew for the first time in July 1963 and featured a more powerful fuel injected 150kW (200hp) IO-360 engine, combining the M-20E's clean aerodynamics and the more powerful engine to give a claimed top speed of 317km/h (171kt). From the mid 1960s all models gained a small fin fillet and a larger squared off rear cabin window. \r\n\r\nThe M-20F Executive 21 of 1965 was based on the M-20E Super 21 and had a 25cm (10in) fuselage stretch and an extra cabin window on each side, new cabin fittings and extra fuel. In 1967 the range was renamed, the M-20C becoming the Ranger, the M-20F continued as the Executive, the M-20E was discontinued for a time until reappearing as the Chaparral, and a new model, the M-20G Statesman (with the Executive's fuselage and a 135kW/180hp engine) appeared (although only 183 were built). \r\n\r\nFor a time from 1970 Mooney was known as the Aerostar Aircraft Corporation, and the Ranger became the Aerostar 200, the Chaparral the 201 and Executive the 220.

In 1934 Noorduyn formed Noorduyn Aircraft Ltd (Noorduyn Aviation from 1938). Later in 1934 Noorduyn began work on the Norseman, resulting in the first flight of the float equipped prototype Norseman I from the St Lawrence River on November 14 1935. \r\n\r\nThe Norseman I prototype was powered by a 315kW (420hp) Wright Whirlwind, featured spruce wing spars and a metal tubing fuselage frame with fabric covering. It was the first Canadian aircraft with flaps. \r\n\r\nFurther development resulted in the heavier Norseman II production aircraft, and the 335kW (450hp) P&W Wasp Junior powered Norseman III. The 415kW (550hp) Norseman IV was the subject of significant Royal Canadian Air Force and civil orders in 1938. \r\n\r\nThe USA's entry into WW2 in late 1941 saw the US Army Air Force take delivery of 746 Norsemans in YC-64, UC-64A (originally C-64A), and UC-64B variants. These aircraft operated in many theatres and were sometimes equipped with floats or skis. Other air forces that operated the Norseman were Canada, Australia, Brazil, Netherlands East Indies, Honduras, Indonesia, Norway, Sweden, and the US Navy. \r\n\r\nThe Norseman V, which was produced from the end of WW2 by Noorduyn and later by CCF, is the civil equivalent of the UC-64A. \r\n\r\nWith the aircraft no longer needed for war, Noorduyn production ceased in 1945 and its Cartierville plant was taken over by Canadair. However through to 1959 Canadian Car and Foundry built small numbers of Norseman Vs for civil customers.\r\n\r\nCCF developed a new version, the Norseman VII, with all-metal wings and tailplane, a 91.4cm (3ft) longer cabin, and the engine moved forward 30.5cm (12in). The aircraft was converted from a Norseman V, and the first flight was made in Montreal in the autumn of 1951. It was however never certificated and not taken into production.  \r\n\r\nAfter the war many ex military Norsemans found gainful use with civil operators, and even to this day approximately 18 fly in Canada. \r\n\r\n"}, {"relatedLinks": "North American Rockwell 100 Darter/Lark Commander", "capacity": "Typical seating for four.", "dimensions": "Darter - Wing span 10.67m (35ft 0in), length 6.86m (22ft 6in), height 2.84m (9ft 4in).

The end of WW2 saw massive military contracts cancelled en masse and so North American designed the original four seat NA145 to diversify out of military production. The NA145 Navion was powered by a 140kW (185hp) Continental and North American built more than 1100 in 1946 and 1947. North American also built a number of L17 observation aircraft based on the Navion for the US military. \r\n\r\nProduction and development of the Navion then transferred to Ryan. The standard Ryan production model was the Navion 205 or Navion A, which differed from the North American NA145 in that it was powered by a 155kW (205hp) Continental E185. More than 100 were built between 1948 and 1950. Ryan also built a few hundred Navion Super 260s or Navion Bs between 1950 and 1951, these aircraft were powered by a 195kW (260hp) Lycoming GO435. In addition Ryan also built almost 200 L17s (some saw military service in Korea). \r\n\r\nThe basic Navion design resurfaced in 1960 when the Navion Aircraft Company developed a five seater variant called the Rangemaster. The Rangemaster was powered by the same 195kW (260hp) Lycoming engine as the Navion Super 260, but instead of the rear sliding canopy of earlier Navions, the Rangemaster had a reprofiled, more streamlined five seat cabin. Later production Rangemasters had a smaller tail. \r\n\r\nThe Rangemaster was last built by the Navion Rangemaster Aircraft Corporation between 1974 and 1976 in improved G and H form. \r\n\r\nCamair in the USA also converted a small number of Navions of various models to twin engine configuration, the first flew in 1953. \r\n\r\n"}, {"relatedLinks": "Pacific Aerospace CT-4 Airtrainer", "capacity": "Normally two seats side by side, with space for optional third seat or baggage behind.", "dimensions": "CT-4A - Wing span 7.92m (26ft 0in), length 7.06m (23ft 2in), height 2.59m (8ft 6in).

Victa had developed the four place Aircruiser (first flight in mid 1966) based on the Airtourer, but development work ceased and instead the production rights for the Aircruiser were purchased by Aero Engine Services Ltd (or AESL) of New Zealand in 1969, which already had the rights to the Airtourer series. \r\n\r\nAESL made a number of changes to the basic Aircruiser design, including adding a new clamshell canopy, structural strengthening for aerobatic work, and stick controls, making it suitable for military basic training. The first such CT-4 Airtrainer flew on February 23 1972. This prototype was powered by a 157kW (210hp) Teledyne Continental IO-360-D engine. \r\n\r\nOn April 1 1973 AESL merged with Air Parts (NZ) Ltd as New Zealand Aerospace Industries Ltd. Delivery of the first production model, the CT-4A, started in October 1973. The CT-4A differed from the CT-4 prototype in having an IO-360-H engine, a longer cockpit canopy, a larger dorsal fin fairing, and some other improvements. Primary customers were the Australian, New Zealand and Thai air forces. The CT-4B was a version with some minor modifications for civil certification. Production by New Zealand (also known as NZAI) continued until 1977. \r\n\r\nIn 1990 Pacific Aerospace Corporation (the successor to NZAI) resumed production of the CT-4B against an order from the BAe/Ansett Flying College (later BAe Flight Training) in Tamworth, Australia, providing the impetus for further developments of the line. \r\n\r\nA turboprop Allison 250 powered CT-4C (a conversion of an ex RAAF CT-4A) flew on January 21 1991, and a retractable undercarriage version, the CT-4CR was proposed but not built. Development of the 225kW (300hp) IO-540 powered CT-4E was aimed for the US Air Force's Enhanced Flight Screening competition. Thirty two CT-4Es have been built, including 13 for the Royal New Zealand Air Force to replace CT-4As (10 of which were refurbished and sold to British Aerospace Flight Training in Australia).

Not deterred by Gates' withdrawal, Piaggio assumed total control of the program, and all tooling and three forward fuselages for what would have been the Learjet P.180 were transferred to Italy. \r\n\r\nPiaggio flew the first of two P.180 prototypes on September 23 1986, the second flew in May 1987. Italian certification was granted in March 1990, the first production Avanti flew that May and the first customer delivery took place in September 1990. \r\n\r\nThe unorthodox Avanti remains unique for a corporate aircraft in that it features three flying surfaces - the canard foreplane, wing and tail. This arrangement not only offers the benefits of the canard, but meant the wing could be positioned in the rear of the fuselage, so that it didn't intrude on available interior cabin space. The small natural laminar flow wing was designed by the Ohio State University. The pusher engine configuration was chosen to reduce cabin noise. \r\n\r\nComposites are used in a number of areas, including the tail, engine nacelles, canards, outboard wing flaps, landing gear doors and the tail cone, but generally, unlike the Beech Starship, most construction is conventional.

Taylor. In the middle of 1930, his company, Taylor Brothers Aircraft Corporation, went bankrupt. Businessman William Piper, who had made large profits from the oil industry, purchased the assets of the company and formed Taylor Aircraft Company with C.G. Taylor as the Chief Engineer.  \r\n\r\nMr. Piper wanted to produce a simple and economic training aircraft, and the result was the E-2. The prototype was powered by a tiny 15kW (20hp) Brownbach Tiger Kitten engine. The aircraft was grossly underpowered with this engine, but at least, as Tiger Kitten equals Cub, it was the source of the model name for the E-2. After the Tiger Kitten had been replaced by a Salmson D-9 engine, real flight was finally achieved. However, as this French engine was built to metric sizes, the new 28kW(37hp) Continental A-40 was installed in the second E-2, and with this engine the Taylor E-2 Cub was certified on June 15 1931. \r\n\r\nThe company continued building the E-2 under the Taylor banner from 1931 to 1936, 348 being built in total.\r\n\r\nWhile C.G. Taylor was ill, Walter Jamouneau reworked the E-2 Cub in early 1935, and the new type was named the J-2 Cub. It featured a revised tail shape, a fuselage with a faired-in rear turtledeck and a closed cockpit, a new airfoil wing with rounded wingtips, a redesigned cowling and a wider track undercarriage. Mr. Taylor was not happy with these developments and therefore decided to leave the company to form Taylor-Young Company. \r\n\r\nThe first experimental J-2 was a conversion of an E-2 and first flew in early 1935. The first production aircraft followed in December the same year. The aircraft was powered by the 28kW (37hp) Continental A40-3.\r\n\r\nEffective November 1 1937 the company name was changed to Piper Aircraft Corporation, while continuing production of the J-2.\r\n\r\nDuring 1936-37, the J-2 was improved and updated, resulting in the J-3 Cub. The affordable J-3 became a runaway sales success and several thousand were sold before the USA's entry into WW2. From then on, all J-3 production was for the US Army Air Force, originally as the O-59 which quickly became the L-4. Also the US Navy ordered the aircraft, as the NE-1.\r\n\r\nPrewar Piper also built the J-4 Cub Coupe with side by side seating and the three seat J-5 Cub Cruiser. \r\n\r\nPostwar Piper reverted to civilian production with the J-3 later becoming the PA-11 Cub Special. Late build PA-11s were powered by a 65kW (90hp) Continental C-90 and had increased range. The PA-12 Super Cruiser has seating for three and a more powerful Lycoming O-235 engine, while the four seat PA-14 Family Cruiser formed the basis for the Super Cub. \r\n\r\n"}, {"relatedLinks": "Piper PA-18 Super Cub", "capacity": "Typical seating for two in tandem.", "dimensions": "PA-18-95 - Wing span 10.73m (35ft 3in), length 6.83m (22ft 5in), height 2.02m (6ft 9in).

Piper continued building Super Cubs on behalf of Texas based WTA who held the manufacturing and marketing rights from 1981 until 1988. In 1988 Piper resumed marketing responsibility for the Super Cub and continued low rate production. Financial troubles meant that Super Cub production ceased in 1992, before resuming once more the following year. Finally in late 1994 Piper announced that the Super Cub would not form part of its model line for 1995 and that it would cease production after the last of 24 on order for distributor Muncie Aviation were completed. \r\n\r\n"}, {"relatedLinks": "Piper PA-20/22 Pacer/Tri-Pacer/Caribbean/Colt", "capacity": "Pacer and Tri-Pacers (including Caribbean) typically seat four, while the Colt seats two side by side.

From 1952 to 1954 the Tri-Pacer was powered by a 100kW (135hp) O-290-D2 engine, and in 1955 gained a 110kW (150hp) O-320-A2B engine and a higher takeoff weight, and a 120kW (160hp) O-320-B from 1958. For 1959 and 1960 Piper offered a lower spec less expensive version of the Tri-Pacer in the form of the PA-22-150 Caribbean. \r\n\r\nThe two seat PA-22-108 Colt was derived from the Tri-Pacer but had a less powerful 85kW (108hp) engine, lower maximum takeoff weight, no rear cabin windows, the removal of a rear door and less fuel capacity, but otherwise the two airframes were identical.

The major change (also introduced on the fixed undercarriage PA-28s at that time) was a new longer tapered span wing, while the maximum takeoff weight was increased. The turbocharged PA-28R-201T was also offered. \r\n\r\nThe PA-28RT-201 and -201T Arrow IV introduced a new all moving T-tail. Production of the Arrow IV ceased in 1982, and resumed again in 1989, but ceased once more in 1992. Instead Piper returned the conventional-tailed Arrow III back into production. Very small numbers were built in the early 1990s while Piper was under bankruptcy protection.

First flight of a production Twin Comanche was in May 1963, with first deliveries later that year. \r\n\r\nThe Twin Comanche differed little from its single engine brethren other than changes associated with its twin engine layout, and it quickly proved to be very popular.

While the wing was based on the Cherokee's, the fuselage was substantially larger, with strengthened undercarriage and a larger tail. \r\n\r\nThe Cherokee Six first flew on December 6 1963, while deliveries of production PA-32-260s began from mid 1965. Development led to a range of improved models, starting with the 225kW (300hp) fuel injected IO-540 powered Cherokee Six 300 (PA-32-300). Production of the 260 and 300 ended in the late 1970s, but in the meantime they had been joined by the PA-32R Cherokee Lance. The Cherokee Lance, or just Lance from mid 1977 with the introduction of the improved Lance II, was a retractable undercarriage development. The Lance II and turbocharged PA-32R-300T Turbo Lance also introduced a T-tail as the PA-32RT and remained in production to late 1979. \r\n\r\nThe Lance II and Cherokee Six were replaced by the Saratoga. Available in fixed or retractable undercarriage form, with standard or turbocharged powerplants, the major change was the new increased span tapered wing. \r\n\r\nProduction of the Saratoga ceased in 1985, but New Piper reintroduced the Saratoga II HP in 1993 with aerodynamic improvements and a revised instrument panel and interior.

Production deliveries of the initial PA-34-200 Seneca began in late 1971. \r\n\r\nHandling and performance criticisms were addressed from the 1974 model year with the PA-34-200T Seneca II which introduced changes to the flight controls and, more importantly, two turbocharged Continental TSIO-360-Es. Piper originally planned that the follow-on PA-34-220T Seneca III would feature a T-tail, but these plans were dropped and the main changes introduced were counter rotating 165kW (220hp) TSIO-360s and a revised interior and instrument panel. Introduced in 1981, the Seneca III was replaced by New Piper's improved PA-34-220T Seneca IV in 1994 with aerodynamic refinements, axisymetric engine inlets and a revised interior. \r\n\r\nThe current PA-34-220T Seneca V was introduced in January 1997.

The Lycoming engine was later in the development program replaced by a 210kw (285hp) Continental Tiara 6-285 engine, and the aircraft became the PA-36-285. A second prototype had the same engine, and Piper decided to use this engine for the series production.\r\n\r\nThe PA-36 has a welded chrome-molybdenum steel tube fuselage structure with metal underskins and plastics side panels, and a sturdy overturn pylon is part of the structure.

A hopper with a capacity of 30 or 38 cu.ft is in front of the pilot.  \r\n\r\nIn mid 1972 the PA-36-285 received FAA approval, and in 1973 production got under way, while at the same time the name was changed from Pawnee II to Pawnee Brave.  \r\n\r\nAs the Continental Tiara engine was quite problematic, Piper certificated a 225kW (300hp) Lycoming IO-540 powered version, the PA-36-300, which replaced the Tiara engined version on the production line from the 1977 model year.  From the 1978 model year, the name Pawnee Brave was changed to Brave 300.\r\n\r\nA more powerful version was available from 1978, powered by a 280kW (375hp) Lycoming IO-720 in a restyled cowling, as the Brave 375, and from 1982 the 300kW (400hp) IO-720 powered Brave 400 followed. \r\n\r\nPawnee Brave production ceased in January 1983. \r\n\r\n"}, {"relatedLinks": "Piper PA-38 Tomahawk", "capacity": "Seating for two side by side.", "dimensions": "Wing span 10.36m (34ft 0in), length 7.04m (23ft 1in), height 2.77m (9ft 1in).

With their responses in mind (ideal characteristics included night lighting, dual toe brakes, a fuel selector accessible to both student and instructor, low noise levels, position lights and the ability to spin), Piper developed the PA-38. The resulting aircraft featured a T-tail and NASA Whitcomb GA(W)-1 design low set wing of constant chord and thickness (also featured on the competing but less succesful Beech Skipper), a cabin wider than the Cherokee's (and thus much wider than the Cessna 150/152's) with 360\u00b0 vision and a Lycoming O-235 powerplant. Many parts, such as the main undercarriage wheels and elevators, were interchangeable. \r\n\r\nPiper announced the development of the Tomahawk during late 1977 and first deliveries were made in early 1978. Despite an initial mixed reaction to the new trainer from the flying public, the Tomahawk was an instant sales success with over 1000 built in the first year of production alone. In service the Tomahawk proved to be economical to operate, but the aircraft was dogged by quality control problems (some 19 Airworthiness Directives were issued by the FAA in the PA-38's first four years) and unpredictable stalling characteristics, resulting in a number of stall/spin accidents. \r\n\r\nFlow strips were added to the wing on late production Tomahawks Is in September 1978 to improve the much criticised stall characteristics, while a number of other problems, including the poor quality control, were addressed in the improved Tomahawk II, which was introduced for the 1981 model year. Enhancements included improved sound proofing, windscreen defrosting, door latching and nose wheel design. \r\n\r\nPiper ceased production of the Tomahawk during 1983. \r\n\r\n"}, {"relatedLinks": "Piper PA-42 Cheyenne III/400", "capacity": "One or two pilots on flightdeck, with main cabin seating for between six and nine passengers.

Nevertheless, the PA-46 has sold relatively strongly. \r\n\r\nAnnounced in November 1982, the Malibu was intended to compete against Cessna's pressurised P210 Centurion, plus older light business twins. Designed with the aid of CAD/CAM (Computer Aided Design/Computer Aided Manufacture), an unpressurized experimental prototype, the PA-46-300T, flew for the first time on November 30, 1979. The prototype for the first production model, the pressurized PA-46-310P, first flew in August 1982. Certification was awarded in September 1983, with production deliveries from that November. \r\n\r\nFeatures of the first production model PA-46-310P included the specially developed turbocharged 230kW (310hp) Continental TSIO-520, a high aspect ratio wing, a relatively roomy cabin with club seating for four behind the pilot, a rear airstair style door, IFR avionics as standard, and cabin pressurisation. \r\n\r\nThe improved PA-46-350P Malibu Mirage, first flight December 21, 1987, replaced the 310P Malibu in production from October 1988. The major change introduced on the Malibu Mirage was the 260kW (350hp) Textron Lycoming TIO-540-AE2A, while other changes included a new electrical system and revised interior. \r\n\r\nSince 1994 New Piper has made a number of minor improvements to the Malibu Mirage including to the brakes, autopilot and air-conditioning. In 1999 the Mirages gained the strengthened wing of the turboprop Malibu Meridian development, allowing an 18kg (40lb) increase in max takeoff weight. The Mirage is also offered with conventional and EFIS avionics packages. Production ceased temporarily in 2001 to allow Piper to concentrate on introducing the Meridian to production, but was later resumed. Production is continuing alongside the turboprop PA-46-500TP Malibu Meridian (see separate entry).\r\n\r\nA turboprop conversion is available from Jetprop as the DLX (see Malibu Meridian entry). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}, {"relatedLinks": "Piper PA-60 Aerostar", "capacity": "Typical seating for six.", "dimensions": "600A - Wing span 10.41m (34ft 2in), length 10.61m (34ft 10in), height 3.89m (12ft 1in).

However the Aerostar appeared in piston twin form only. Smith began design work on the Aerostar in late 1964, with a prototype making its first flight two years later in November 1966. \r\n\r\nThe prototype was powered by 120kW (160hp) Lycoming IO-320s, but the Aerostar was placed into production from 1968 as the Aerostar 600 with 215kW (290hp) IO-540s. The turbocharged Aerostar 601 followed the 600 into production shortly afterwards, while the turbocharged and pressurised 601P went into production in 1972. By this time Butler Aviation had acquired the production rights of the Aerostar in 1970, producing a small number as Butler Aerostars. Smith bought the line back again in 1972, and his new company Ted R Smith and Associates resumed Aerostar manufacture, including of the improved 601B with the same span wings as on the 601P, until Piper acquired the Aerostar line in March 1978. \r\n\r\nPiper continued production of the 600A, 601B and 601P at Ted Smith's Santa Maria plant, and introduced the 602P with low compression TIO-540-AA1A5 engines. \r\n\r\nWhen Piper transferred production to its new Vero Beach, Florida factory in early 1982, only the 602P was in production, and this was redesignated the PA-60-602P. The PA-60-700P was the last Aerostar version, and just 25 were built. In production between 1983 and 1985, the 700P has more powerful engines, a higher max takeoff weight and optional extra fuel capacity. \r\n\r\n"}, {"relatedLinks": "Pitts S-1/2 Special", "capacity": "S-1 series seats pilot only. \r\nS-2 series seats two, except for S-2S which seats pilot only.", "dimensions": "S-1S - Wing span 5.28m (17ft 4in), length 4.71m (15ft 6in), height 1.91m (6ft 3in).

The aircraft was of steel tube construction with fabric covering over wooden spars, while the two wings were braced with wire. Power in early aircraft was supplied by 65 to 95kW (90 to 125hp) four cylinder Continentals or Lycomings. Later models were higher powered and of conventional metal construction.\r\n\r\nThe early Pitts Special aircraft were custom built, differing in detail and powerplant employed. Examples are e.g. \"Little Stinker\" built for Betty Skelton in 1947 with a 65kW (90hp) Continental and \"Black Beauty\" built for Caro Bailey with a 95kW (125hp) Lycoming O-290-D. These models featured two ailerons and flat bottom wings.\r\n\r\nThe first model for which drawings were available, from 1962, was the S-1C. Like the original S-1, this model had two ailerons and flat bottom wings. The homebuilder could choose between several engines of different horsepower.\r\n\r\nA second model for which only plans were available, was the S-1D. This differed from the S-1C in having four ailerons and a slightly longer fuselage.  \r\n\r\nFactory production (initially by Aerotek) of the basic single seat S-1 Special started with the S-1S with a 135kW (180hp) Lycoming IO-360-B4A, driving a fixed pitch prop, and featuring symmetrical instead of flat bottom wings, with four ailerons. Plans and kits of this version were also available, as the S-1SE (originally named S-1E).\r\n\r\nThe S-1T was introduced to production in 1981, and introduced a 150kW (200hp) Lycoming (now Textron Lycoming) AEIO-360-A1E driving a constant speed prop and with symmetrical wings with four ailerons. Also the wings were moved forward 11.5cm (4.5in) compared with the S-1S. The S-1T was also available as a kit, as the S-1TE. \r\n\r\nThe two seat S-2 Special is of the same configuration as the single seat S-1 but is larger overall, and generally regarded as a more capable aerobatic aircraft due to its larger size and heavier weight, more power and aerodynamic changes. For this reason the S-2 is also built in single seat 195kW (260hp) AEIO-540 powered S-2S form (kit version S-2SE), while two seat models are the S-2 with a 135kW (180hp) Lycoming O-360-B4A with fixed pitch propeller (kit version S-2E), the S-2A with a 150kW (200hp) IO-360-A1A with constant speed propeller (kit version S-2AE), and the S-2B with a 195kW (260hp) AEIO-540 engine and with wings and landing gear moved forward 10cm (4in). The S-2B is fully aerobatic with two occupants. The S-2C has aerodynamic changes including square wingtips, fin and tailplanes, flattened belly, refined engine cowl and redesigned windshield. It cruises 24km/h (13kt) faster than the S-2B. \r\n\r\nThe Pitts Special has been factory built by Aerotek, Christen, and currently Aviat.\r\n\r\nPlans and components for the S-1C and S-1SS (S-1S with the aileron technology of the S-1-11B Super Stinker) are currently available from Steen Aero Lab.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}, {"relatedLinks": "PZL Swidnik (Mil) Mi2 & Kania", "capacity": "Mi2 - Two pilots or one pilot and passenger on flightdeck, and main cabin seating for seven.

From the outset the aim was to certificate the aircraft to western standards. The first prototype of the basic single seat M-18 first flew on August 27 1976, a second prototype flew that October. Poland awarded certification for the Dromader during September 1978, and series production began the following year. \r\n\r\nThe basic Dromader design was conventional, with power supplied by a nine cylinder radial engine, while the outer wing panels were based on those on the Rockwell Thrush Commander. \r\n\r\nThe basic single seat M-18 was in production for five years until 1984 when it was replaced by the two seat M-18A, but has been available to special order since. The two seat M-18A was developed to allow the carriage of either a mechanic or chemical loader to austere fields. In the meantime PZL-Mielec had developed a firebombing derivative which first flew in 1978. The M-18AS trainer has a second cockpit for flight instruction. Since 1996 the M-18B, with a 5300kg (11,684lb) max takeoff weight, has been the standard production model. The M-18BS is a two seat trainer based on the M-18B. The M-18C with 895kW (1200hp) Kalisz K-9 engine flew in 1995 but has not entered production. \r\n\r\nIn the USA, Melex (part owned by PZL-Mielec) developed a PT6A-45 turboprop development dubbed the M-18/T45 Turbine Dromader. The Turbine Dromader first flew during 1985 and the US FAA issued it a Supplementary Type Certificate in April 1986. Others have been converted with a PT6A-65, TPE331-10 or T53-L-7 turbine engine. \r\n\r\n"}, {"relatedLinks": "PZL-Okecie PZL-110/111 Koliber", "capacity": "Typical seating for four.", "dimensions": "160A & 235A - Wing span 9.75m (32ft 0in), length 7.37m (24ft 2in), height 2.80m (9ft 2in).

Raytheon worked closely with potential customers for the replacement for the Hawker 1000 in the design definition stage, and their input directly influenced the direction of the new aircraft. \r\n\r\nRaytheon formally announced the Hawker Horizon immediately prior to the National Business Aircraft Association's annual convention in November 1996. The Horizon is due to make its first flight in late 1999, followed by certification and first deliveries in the northern spring of 2001. \r\n\r\nOne of Raytheon's design philosophies in developing the Horizon is to combine the earlier Hawkers' popular characteristics with advanced technologies.

The original concept was one that was quite popular during the 1940s - to provide a four seat light aircraft that would cost little more to purchase and operate than a family car. To an extent Republic succeeded in its aims, more than 1000 Seabees were built in just one year of production. \r\n\r\nThe original prototype Seabee was designated the RC1 (Republic Commercial design number one) and first appeared during 1944. The RC1 was a three seat design powered by a 130kW (175hp) six cylinder Franklin 6ALG365 piston engine. First flown during November 1944, the conventional all metal construction RC1 for a time was dubbed the Thunderbolt Amphibian. \r\n\r\nA comprehensive testing and development program ensued, during which the RC1 was punishingly tested. One test that illustrated that the RC-1 encompassed Republic aircraft's legendary abilities to absorb punishment involved intentionally making a wheelsup landing on a concrete runway. The RC1 passed this test without incident, the only damage being a small metal shaving from the keel. \r\n\r\nWhile the RC1's structural integrity was beyond dispute, Republic nevertheless decided to redesign the RC1, mainly to significantly reduce production and acquisition costs. What evolved was the RC3 Seabee, a four seater powered by a 160kW (215hp) Franklin 6A8215B8F piston engine. Aside from the increased seating capacity, the Seabee differed from the RC1 in being lighter, built with far fewer components (450 compared with 1800 in the RC1), required 25% less tooling to manufacture and, most importantly, had an acquisition cost half that of what the RC1's would have been. \r\n\r\nSeabee production began in mid 1946, but lasted only until October 1947, when ironically Republic decided to concentrate on its once more lucrative military business, despite healthy Seabee sales. \r\n\r\nThe decision to cease Seabee production also terminated development plans for twin engined and landplane developments. \r\n\r\n"}, {"relatedLinks": "Robin DR-400/500", "capacity": "DR-400-120 seats two adults and two children, most other DR-400 models typically seat four adults.", "dimensions": "Wing span 8.72m (28ft 7in), length 6.96m (22ft 10in), height 2.23m (7ft 3in).

The company's initial production was of developments of the basic Jodel series of tail draggers, and it was these aircraft that evolved into the DR-400 series. Initial production was of the DR-100 and the DR-1050/1051, while the DR-220, DR-221 and DR-250 featured the Jodel's basic wing with a four seat fuselage. The final links between the Jodels and the DR-400 were the DR-253 and DR-300 series, tricycle developments of the DR-220 series. \r\n\r\nFirst flight of the DR-400 occurred during June 1972, both a DR-400-125 and a DR-400-180 taking flight that month. Essentially, the DR-400 was an improved DR-300 with a forward-sliding canopy replacing the doors of the previous model. \r\n\r\nSince that time a number of developments have been offered.

The DR-400-125I has a 93kW (125hp) fuel injected IO-240 and was revealed in 1995. The DR-400-140 Dauphin is powered by a 120kW (160hp) O-320 and is a full four seater. The four seat DR-400-160 Chevalier meanwhile also features a 120kW (160hp) Lycoming O-320 and seats four. It first flew in June 1972. With a different prop, more fuel capacity and slightly different wing it became the DR-400-160 Major from 1980. \r\n\r\nThe four/five seat DR 400-180 Regent and DR-400-180R Remo 180 are powered by the 135kW (180hp) (Textron) Lycoming O-360, the Remo being optimised for glider towing.

It first flew on July 19 1971 powered by an 80kW (108hp) O235, while the first production aircraft flew in April 1973. <p>Three initial versions were built, the 80kW (108hp) powered Club or HR 200/100, the more powerful Acrobin 125 or HR 200/125 (with a 95kW/125hp O235) and the Acrobin 160 or HR 200/160 (with a 120kW/160hp IO320). The HR 200 remained in production until the late 1970s, and is once again on offer. Robin has now recommenced production of the HR 200/120 as the Robin 200, with power supplied by an 88kW (118hp) Textron Lycoming O235L2A and a new instrument panel. <p>The R 2000 Alpha series meanwhile was a redevelopment of the HR 200. The HR 200's basic fuselage was retained, but changes included an all new wing and a enlarged rudder and vertical tail to improve spinning characteristics. The prototype R 2000 was powered by a 135kW (160hp) IO320 and flew for the first time on January 15 1976. Deliveries of production aircraft began in 1977. <p>Three developments of the R 2000 series were built, the R 2100, the R 2112 and R 2160 Alpha Sport, with the main differences between the three being the powerplant fitted. The R 2100 is powered by an 80kW (108hp) O235, the R 2112 has an 84kW (112hp) O235, and the R 2160 has a 120kW (160hp) O320. Of the three, the R 2160 Alpha Sport has been the most popular.

Variants, apart from the experimental 360, include the 560A which introduced the 25cm (10in) stretched fuselage that became the standard short fuselage length, the 560E which introduced the definitive wing span, the 720 Alti Cruiser pressurised development of the 680 and the later pressurised 680PF. \r\n\r\nThe 560 and 680 were joined by the stretched 680FL Grand Commander from 1962. The 500 was introduced to production in 1958 and was originally intended as a low cost model. \r\n\r\nIn 1967 North American Rockwell took over Aero Commander and the Grand Commander became the Courser Commander and the 500 became the Shrike Commander (gaining its distinctive pointed nose at the same time). The Shrike Commander was the last Commander to remain in production, manufacture ending in 1980. \r\n\r\nThe final piston powered model to appear was the Rockwell 685 Commander, which was a piston powered Turbo Commander.\r\n\r\nIn US military service, the designation for the aircraft was originally L-26, in 1962 renamed to U-4 (Air Force) and U-9 (Army). Two U-4Bs (ex L-26Cs), an Air Force version of the 680, were ordered by the USAF as presidential aircraft for President Dwight D. Eisenhower. They were used from 1956 to 1960 for short trips.

When the Belfast entered service with the RAF in January 1966 it was the largest aircraft to be operated by that service. \r\n\r\nThe Belfast's military career was relatively short lived, and all 10 were retired in 1976. Heavylift (then TAC Heavylift) acquired five Belfasts for commercial service in 1977, and three were placed into service in 1980. Marshall of Cambridge performed a number of modifications on the Belfast which allowed it to be certificated to civil standards on March 6 1980. Since then Heavylift's Belfasts have given the company a useful heavylift capability to carry heavy and awkward sized loads, bettered only by its An-124s. One remained in use in 1998. \r\n\r\n"}, {"relatedLinks": "Short Skyvan & Skyliner", "capacity": "Flightcrew of one or two.

The US Defense Department awarded Sikorsky a contract to develop such a helicopter in 1948, and the first prototype flew for the first time on November 10 1949. The S-55 saw widespread US military service as H-19 in the Air Force, as H-19 Chickasaw in the Army, as HO4S in the Navy and Coast Guard, and as HRS in the Marine Corps. Civil certification for the commercial S-55 series was first awarded on March 25 1952. \r\n\r\nThe initial civil variant was the S-55, powered by a 450kW (600hp) Pratt & Whitney Wasp radial piston engine. Later civil variants include the S-55A which introduced a 520kW (700hp) Wright R-1300 radial piston engine, while the S-55C had a P&W R-1340 engine and the repositioned tail boom of the S-55A. \r\n\r\nWestland in the UK licence built 400 S-55s as the WS-55 Whirlwind for mainly military but also commercial use. Early Whirlwinds were similar to the S-55 save for their Alvis Leonides radial engine, later developments were powered by a 785kW (1050shp) Rolls-Royce Bristol Gnome H.1000 turboshaft. S-55 licence manufacture was also undertaken in Japan by Mitsubishi and in France by Sud-Est. \r\n\r\nIn January 1971 Aviation Specialties was awarded a type certificate for its turbine powered conversion of the S-55, dubbed the S-55T. Aviation Specialties formed the Helitec Corp to market and convert aircraft, and approximately 40 were fitted with a Garrett AiResearch TSE331 turboshaft. The conversion reduced the S-55's empty weight by approximately 410kg (900lb). \r\n\r\nIn 1993 VAT (Vertical Aviation Technologies Inc) started the development of a super quiet conversion of the S-55, the S-55QT Whisper Jet. Full certification was awarded in December 1999. The 3-bladed main rotor of the standard S-55 was replaced by a 5-bladed one, and the powerplant is an Allied Signal TSE 331-10 turbine engine. It is certified at a MTOW of 3492kg (7700lb). As the S-55QT was specially developed for sightseeing, an additional left side cabin door, center floor window, and larger cabin windows were fitted, and sightseeing-optimized systems and equipment were added.

The US Army operated large numbers as the CH34 Choctaw while many other allied countries operated the S58 in various military roles. The UK for example licence built a turboprop development called the Wessex, some of which saw civil service. \r\n\r\nModest numbers of piston powered S58s saw civil service with most were delivered to customers within the USA. The S58 offered a very large fuselage and lifting capacity, but its piston engine made it expensive to operate. \r\n\r\nIn 1970 Sikorsky announced it was developing a turboprop conversion package for the S58. Turboprop powered S58s are designated the S58T and were initially powered by a 1340kW (1800shp) Pratt & Whitney PT6T3, later aircraft a 1400kW (1875shp) PT6T6. The first S58T conversion flew for the first time on August 19 1970.

The comparatively light weight of the turboshaft meanwhile meant that it could be mounted above the S-62's fuselage, rather than in the nose as on the S55 and S58. \r\n\r\nThe S62 was built in three versions. The prototype flew for the first time on May 14 1958, and the first of the initial production version, the S62A, was delivered to Los Angeles Helicopters in 1961. Only one S62B flew, it differed from the S62A in having the dynamic systems of the S58 (described separately).

It will compete against the Cessna CitationJet/CJ1 and Raytheon Premier I. \r\n\r\nDevelopment work dates back to the SA-30 Fanjet which was announced in October 1986. Swearingen Engineering and Technology, under the leadership of Ed Swearingen (designer of the Metro and Merlin turboprops) began to design and develop the SA-30 for Gulfstream. Gulfstream planned to market the aircraft as the SA-30 Gulfjet, however it withdrew from the program in September 1989. Instead the Jaffe Group took Gulfstream's place. Construction of a prototype began in San Antonio, Texas, but in 1990 the Jaffe Group also withdrew from the then SJ-30 program. \r\n\r\nThe first SJ-30 prototype first flew on February 13 1991 and development progressed slowly until the 1994 announcement that Swearingen would form a joint venture with Taiwanese investors to create Sino Swearingen to build the SJ-30 at a new factory in Martinsburg, West Virginia. \r\n\r\nSino Swearingen decided to enlarge the basic SJ-30, resulting in the 1.32m (4ft 4in) stretched, increased wing span SJ-30-2. The SJ-30 prototype was modified to represent the SJ-30-2 and flew in this configuration in November 1996. The definitive, more powerful FJ44-2A turbofans were installed on this aircraft in September 1997.

The RF-6B first flew in March 1974, and Fournier built 45 RF-6B-100s powered by 75kW (100hp) Rolls Royce Continental O-200 flat fours through to the early 1980s. In 1980 Fournier flew a more powerful development of the RF-6B, the 87kW (116hp) Lycoming O-235 powered RF-6B-120. It was this aircraft that formed the basis for Slingsby's T-67 Firefly. \r\n\r\nSlingsby initially built nine T-67As, which were basically RF-6B-120s, before placing into production its own development of the type, the T-67B. The T-67B was the result of a fairly thorough redevelopment of the T-67A. The main difference was that the T-67B was made almost entirely from glassfibre reinforced plastics (GFRPs), Slingsby drawing on its very extensive experience in that field. The benefits of GFRP include better resistance to fatigue, less weight and less drag. \r\n\r\nThe definitive civil version of the Firefly is the T-67C. The T-67C is similar to the T-67B except for its more powerful 120kW (160hp) Textron Lycoming O-320 engine. Variants of the T-67C are the T-67C-1 with standard fuselage fuel tankage and one piece canopy, the T-67C-2 with a two piece canopy, and the T-67C-3 with wing tanks and three piece canopy. Many T-67Cs have been sold to flying schools and academies (including KLM) while others are in military service. \r\n\r\nThe military Firefly is the T-67M, which first flew in December 1982. The first model was the T-67M-160 with a 119kW (160hp) Textron Lycoming AEIO-320-D1B engine. With the introduction of wing fuel tanks and two-piece canopy, the designation was changed to T-67M Mk2. The next variant was the T-67M-200 with a 149kW (200hp) AEIO-360-A1E which made the first flight on May 16 1985. The final variant was the T-67M-260 (powered by a 195kW (260hp) AEIO-540) first flown in May 1991. \r\n\r\nMany T-67M are used for military initial pilot training and screening, and 113 T-67M-260s  were delivered to the US Air Force as the T-3A Firefly, while some are used by civilian flight schools for airline and military training (the latter under government contract). T-67Ms have aerobatic capable engines and two blade constant speed propellers, among other changes, compared with the T-67C. \r\n\r\n"}, {"relatedLinks": "Socata GY-80 Horizon & ST-10 Diplomate", "capacity": "Typical seating for four.", "dimensions": "GY-80-160 - Wing span 9.70m (31ft 10in), length 6.64m (21ft 10in), height 2.60m (8ft 6in).

Gardan built a prototype as a private development which flew on July 21 1960. Two years later, Sud Aviation (now Aerospatiale) acquired the design and production rights for the GY-80 and placed the type into production. Sud Aviation built three preproduction development aircraft before placing the GY-80 into production in late 1963. \r\n\r\nA key aspect to the GY-80 was its simple design and method of construction. The GY-80 was of conventional appearance but slightly unusual construction, with an aluminium skinned steel tubular framework for the cabin area, and monocoque tailcone bolted aft. It featured a retractable tricycle undercarriage, Frise slotted ailerons and Fowler flaps. The flaps are permanently connected to the undercarriage linkage which is wound up and down manually with a handle protruding from the instrument panel. To reduce maintenance costs, the flaps, ailerons and horizontal tail pieces were interchangeable (in theory, but they needed to be modified if they were previously used at any other position). The Horizon was built using car assembly techniques, with just 11 production jigs. \r\n\r\nThree versions of the Horizon were built, differing in powerplant and fuel tankage. These were the 110kW (150hp) Lycoming O-320-A powered GY-80-150, the 120kW (160hp) O-320-B2B powered GY-80-160, and the 135kW (180hp) Lycoming O-360-A powered GY-80-180. These were built firstly by Sud Aviation, and then by its newly established light aircraft division, Socata, from 1966. \r\n\r\nSocata flew an improved development of the GY-80, initially called the Super Horizon 200, on November 7 1967. This new development featured a stretched cabin and a more powerful 150kW (200hp) fuel injected Lycoming IO-360-C. In production between 1969 and 1974, the Super Horizon was renamed Provence, and then the ST-10 Diplomate, the latter becoming the type's definitive name. \r\n\r\n"}, {"relatedLinks": "Socata MS 180 & MS 250 Morane", "capacity": "Typical seating for four or five.", "dimensions": "MS 180/MS 250 - Wing span 9.76m (32ft 0in), length 7.70m (25ft 3in), height 3.02m (9ft 11in).

The first prototype, a TB-10 but powered by a 120kW (160hp) Lycoming O-320, flew for the first time on February 23 1977. Production began in 1979. \r\n\r\nThree distinct versions of the TB series have been built. The TB-9 Tampico is marketed as a trainer and is powered by a four cylinder 120kW (160hp) Lycoming O-320. Until the late 1980s it was available with a fixed pitch propeller as the Tampico FP, or with a constant speed prop as the Tampico CS. Both the Tampico FP and CS had a more up market interior than the current TB-9 Tampico Club which has a two blade fixed pitch Sensenich propeller. The Tampico Sprint meanwhile was launched in 1997 and introduced faired, trailing link undercarriage and a new prop, increasing cruising speed by 18km/h (10kt). \r\n\r\nThe TB-10 Tobago and TB-200 Tobago XL feature faired undercarriage, higher weights, a higher level of interior equipment, more powerful engines and constant speed props. The Tobago is powered by a 135kW (180hp) O-360, the TB-200 Tobago XL a 150kW (200hp) fuel injected IO-360. \r\n\r\nThe top of the range models are the retractable undercarriage TB-20 Trinidad and TB-21 Trinidad TC. The Trinidad is powered by a 185kW (250hp) IO-540, the Trinidad TC a similarly rated turbocharged TIO-540. The TB-20C has a port side freight door.\r\n\r\nIn early 2000 Socata switched production to the improved GT (Generation Two) series of all four models. The GTs feature the slightly enlarged cabin developed for the MR series, a curved dorsal fin fairing, upturned wingtips, larger baggage door, and other improvements. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n"}, {"relatedLinks": "Socata TBM-700", "capacity": "Pilot and one passenger (or copilot) on flightdeck.

SNCASE (Societe Nationale de Constructions Aeronautiques de Sud-Est, later Sud Aviation, and subsequently merged into Aerospatiale), responded with a trijet design designated the X120, with three rear mounted SNECMA Atar turbojets. This design then matured to feature two rear mounted Rolls-Royce Avons. \r\n\r\nThe French government ordered two flying and two static prototypes of the twinjet in 1953, resulting in the type's first flight on May 27 1955.

The prototype of the single seat Su26, the originator of the series, flew for the first time in June 1984, and remarkably competed in the World Aerobatic Championships held in Hungary only two months later. \r\n\r\nFeatures introduced on the initial Su26 include the Vedneyev, now VOKBM, M14 nine cylinder piston radial engine, which is highly regarded for its simplicity, power to weight ratio, fuel economy and low oil consumption. The airframe itself is extremely strong, capable of withstanding +11 and 9g, while the wing's aerofoil section is symmetrical and attached to the airframe at zero incidence and dihedral for similar positive and negative angle of attack flight characteristics. \r\n\r\nModifications to the Su26 including a squared off vertical tail and less glass led to the Su26M, which participated in the 1986 World Aerobatic Championships in the UK. The Su26MX is an export version. The success of the Su26 led Sukhoi to design a two seat, dual control development, the Su29, which first flew during 1991. Differences include the second seat, greater span wing and increased length. The Su-29M has lightweight ejection seats. \r\n\r\nThe ultimate development is the Su31, which first flew in June 1992 as the Su29T. The Su31 is a single seater based on the Su29 but with a more powerful engine. The basic version is the Su31T, the Su-31X is for export and the Su31U has retractable undercarriage.

Gilbert Taylor stayed on as president with the company under Piper's ownership (the Taylor name was initially retained) until 1935 when he resigned to establish his own company, this time named Taylorcraft. \r\n\r\nTaylorcraft's first aircraft was similar to the Piper Cub except that it seated two side by side and was powered by a 30kW (40hp) Continental engine. Prewar it was built in A, B, D and D Tandem Trainer form, the last aircraft seating two in tandem. \r\n\r\nThe Tandem Trainer formed the basis for the wartime L-2, nicknamed Grasshopper, and more than 1600 were built during World War 2 for the US Army Air Force. \r\n\r\nPostwar Taylorcraft resumed production of the prewar B-12 as the BC-12D. Almost 3000 BC-12Ds were built before the company encountered financial troubles and the firm was bought out by Gilbert Taylor again, in March 1947. The new Taylorcraft Inc then built the two seat Ace, Traveller, De Luxe and Sportsman; the four seat Tourist, Ranch Wagon, Topper agricultural aircraft and the float equipped Seabird and Zephyr. \r\n\r\nOnce more Taylorcraft ceased trading, and did not reform until 1968 when it was set up to support existing aircraft. In 1973 this company began building the Continental O-200 powered F-19 Sportsman 100, and from 1983 the Lycoming O-235 powered F-21, which were based on the prewar Model B, but production ceased in 1986. Then in January 1990 Taylorcraft flew the improved Textron Lycoming O-235-L2C powered F-22, small numbers of which were built before production ceased for the final time in October 1992. \r\n\r\nUp until production ceased, Taylorcraft might have laid claim to have had the longest production run of any aircraft still using it's original Type Certificate. As well as the F-22 with tailwheel undercarriage, a tricycle model was also introduced, the F-22A, and a prototype with a higher powered 134kW (180hp) O-360 engine, the F-22C.\r\n\r\nToday, the handling characteristics of the F-22A reveal the shortcomings of aged aircraft design, not in the least demanding to fly but solid, unresponsive, slow, noisy, draughty...., just what you would have expected 50 years ago. In its favour the F-22A has an astonishing range, at least 6 hours at cruise power.\r\n\r\n"}, {"relatedLinks": "Technoavia SM92 Finist", "capacity": "One pilot and one passenger on flightdeck.

Both of these short range jetliners suffered from a number of performance shortfalls however, thus prompting development of the Tu-134. \r\n\r\nThe initial Tu-134 design was based fairly closely on the Tu-124, and for a time was designated the Tu-124A. However Tupolev decided to reconfigure the aircraft to feature rear fuselage mounted engines and a Ttail, resulting in the new designation. \r\n\r\nSix development Tu-134s were built, with the first flying during 1962. Production began in 1964 although it was not until September 1967 that Aeroflot launched full commercial services. \r\n\r\nInitial production was of the standard fuselage length Tu-134, while the stretched Tu-134A entered Aeroflot service in the second half of 1970. Seating up to 76 in a single class, the Tu-134A differed from the Tu-134 in having a 2.10m (6ft 11in) fuselage stretch, a reprofiled nose, more powerful D30 engines and an APU. \r\n\r\nOther versions are the Tu-134B with a forward facing position for the third crew member between and behind the pilots, the Tu-134B1 which has a revised interior to seat up to 90 passengers without a galley, and the Tu-134B3 which can seat 96 with full galley and toilet facilities retained. \r\n\r\n"}, {"relatedLinks": "Tupolev Tu-154", "capacity": "Flightcrew of three or four.

Design criteria in replacing these three relatively diverse aircraft included the ability to operate from gravel or packed earth airfields, to be able to fly at high altitudes above most Soviet Union air traffic, and good field performance. To meet these aims the initial Tu-154 design featured three Kuznetsov (now KKBM) NK-8 turbofans (which also powered the larger, longer range Il-62) giving a relatively good thrust to weight ratio, triple bogie main undercarriage units which retract into wing pods and a rear engine T-tail configuration. \r\n\r\nThe Tu-154 first flew on October 4 1968.

The aircraft made its first flight on December 8, 1999. \r\n\r\nThe Tu-334 was based on the much larger Tu-204 twinjet with Tupolev using as many Tu-204 features in the new design as practical to reduce development time and costs. Examples of this include an identical flightdeck and a shortened Tu-204 fuselage. In addition the Tu-334's wing is based on the Tu-204's, although the latter's is a significantly larger unit. \r\n\r\nApart from commonality with the Tu-204, other notable Tu-334 design features were the rear fuselage mounted Progress D-436 turbofans, T-tail and fly-by-wire flight controls. \r\n\r\nIt was planned that the Tu-334 would be developed in a number of versions. The first was the basic Tu-334-100, while the Tu-334-120 was planned to be powered by the BMW Rolls-Royce BR710-48. The Tu-354 (previously Tu-334-200) would have been a stretched, 35m (115ft) long 110 to 126 seater (in a single class). Apart from the fuselage stretch, planned changes included more powerful D436T2 or BR715-55 turbofans, an increased span wing and four wheel main undercarriage units. \r\n\r\nThe Tu-334-100D would have been a longer range Tu-334-100 featuring the 100's standard length fuselage but with more powerful engines, increased fuel capacity, a higher max takeoff weight and the increased span wings of the Tu-334-200. Tupolev also studied the Tu-334C, which would have been a freighter. \r\n\r\nDevelopment of the Tu-334 remained slow due to protracted budget problems and there were numerous delays.  Eventually, in 2009, after the rationalization of the Russian aviation industry, the TU-334 program was cancelled in favor of the Antonov An-148 and the Sukhoi Superjet 100.\r\n\r\n"}, {"relatedLinks": "Vickers VC10", "capacity": "Standard: Typically 109 passengers in two classes, maximum 151 passengers six abreast.

The VC10/type 1100 configuration as settled was: accommodation for about 135 passengers in a BOAC two class layout (or up to 151 all economy class); a six abreast cabin with its cross section based on that of the V.1000 and (coincidentally) the same internal width as the DC-8; 20,000lb (89.6kN) plus thrust Conways mounted in pairs on either side of the rear fuselage; a T-tail (both of these a first for a large jet transport) and in order to meet the stringent runway requirements, a very efficient wing with leading edge slats, outboard ailerons, upper wing spoilers and massive Fowler flaps. A feature was the use of split control surfaces, each driven by separate power units managed by two autopilots, each monitoring the other. The result was a very high level of systems reliability which later allowed the VC10 to become one of the first airliners certified for completely 'hands off' automatic landings in nil visibility.\r\n\r\nThe initial model (which later became known as the 'Standard') was ordered in several versions not only by BOAC but also by Ghana Airways, Nigeria Airways, British United Airlines and the RAF (although the RAF 'Standards' had the wing, fin fuel tank and higher powered engines of the Super to offset the extra weight of their strengthened cargo floor and door). Studies into a higher capacity version of the VC10 were instigated early in the development programme. The result of this, the longer and more economical Super VC10 was eventually only ordered by BOAC and East African Airways.\r\n\r\nBOAC's orders for the VC10 were changed many times, settling on 12 Standards and 17 Supers, considerably less than the original 35 orders plus 20 options. Amongst the cancellations were 8 Supers which would have been built as a mixed passenger/freighter version with the large cargo door as had been developed for the Standard. This version eventually did fly as East African Airways bought 5 Type 1154s but the full potential of this 'combi' version was never fully exploited. \r\n\r\nThe total production run eventually totalled out at 32 aircraft for the Standard and 22 for the Super, not an impressive number compared to the monthly numbers at Seattle or Toulouse. In it's time the VC10 was the largest aircraft that had ever been produced in the United Kingdom, and although a very sophisticated design it completely lost out to the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8. The VC10 became the victim of several issues, the two main ones being the timing of it's debut and the Standard's compromise between performance and operating costs. By the time the Super's improved economics appeared it was already too late for the VC10 to claim any significant part of the airline market.\r\n\r\nAfter its civil career, a large number of VC10s was bought by the RAF and converted to air to air refuelling aircraft. The RAF fleet eventually totalling 26 aircraft.

Discussions between the committee and Vickers designers in late 1944, who had already been working on the VC-1 Viking airliner development of the Wellington bomber, resulted in what was eventually to become the Viscount. The committee's requirement was for a 24 seat 1000 mile (1600km/868nm) range airliner, and by the end of 1945 Vickers had selected the Rolls-Royce Dart turboprop engine that was then under development to power the new aircraft. \r\n\r\nIn March 1946 the British government placed a contract with Vickers to build two prototypes of its design (then called Viceroy), one powered by Darts, the other by Armstrong Siddeley Mamba turboprops. By the time of the Dart powered prototype's first flight on July 16 1948 the design had grown to seat 34 and was designated Type 630. The second prototype, the Type 663, was powered by two Rolls-Royce Tay jet engines. Airline indifference to the 34 seat Viscount and the availability of more powerful Dart variants however led Vickers to stretch the design to seat 40. This development was designated the Type 700, and first flew on April 19 1950. \r\n\r\nAirline interest in the Viscount 700 was much stronger, and after receiving certification on April 17 1953 it entered service with BEA the following day. The Viscount was the subject of numerous large orders including from North America, its smoothness, good operating economics and pressurisation contributing to its success. \r\n\r\nCapitalising on the 700's success Vickers developed the stretched 800 with seating for up to 69, while the final Viscount development was the 810 with more powerful engines and higher weights. \r\n\r\n"}, {"relatedLinks": "Victa Aircruiser", "capacity": "Typical seating for four.", "dimensions": "Wing span 7.92m (26ft 0in), length 7.06m (23ft 2in), height 2.59m (8ft 6in).

With Airtourer production in full swing in the early 1960s Victa commissioned Dr Millicer to develop a four seat light aircraft based on the Airtourer. This resulted in the Aircruiser 210CS, which flew for the first time on July 17 1966. The Aircruiser was later awarded full Australian certification equivalent to US FAR Part 23 standards. \r\n\r\nThe Aircruiser showed considerable promise and looked a worthy competitor to American four seaters, however Victa withdrew from light aircraft production in January 1967 due to the Airtourer's inability to compete on price against alleged dumped imports to Australia, and the design and production rights to the Airtourer and Aircruiser were sold to AESL of New Zealand in 1970. AESL continued to build the Airtourer and used the Aircruiser as the basis for its CT-4 Airtrainer (described separately) but did not put the Aircruiser into production. \r\n\r\nIn 1994 Tony Peters, a flying school proprietor in Mount Gambier in South Australia, commissioned a market study into two and four seat light aircraft demand in Australia which found there existed a significant market for new aircraft. A syndicate was formed to purchase the Aircruiser design and type certificate, with Millicer Aircraft Industries established to place an upgraded development of the Aircruiser into production as the M-9-200 Shrike. The Shrike name was dropped in 1998 in favour of AirCruiser (with an upper case \"C\"). \r\n\r\nOriginally plans envisaged the first M-9-200 being delivered in mid 1997 but minor delays and the decision to acquire the Airtourer design and place it into production as a priority meant that the first M-9-200 - the rebuilt Aircruiser prototype - was not due to fly until September 1999 with first customer deliveries planned for 2000. AirCruisers and AirTourers would be built in a new, purpose designed factory in Sale in Victoria.\r\n\r\nCompared with the original Victa Aircruiser, the M-9-200 AirCruiser would have featured a fuel injected IO-360 engine, standard GPS, new wheels, brakes and controls.

Victa's first all metal prototype of the Airtourer first flew on December 12 1961, powered by a 70kW (95hp) engine. Production aircraft were powered by a 75kW (100hp) Continental engine, and the first production Airtourer 100 flew in June 1962. Type approval was awarded the following month. The more powerful Airtourer 115 flew for the first time in September 1962, powered by a Lycoming O-235. \r\n\r\nVicta built 170 production Airtourers before its inability to compete against cheap American imports (which were aided by a favourable exchange rate) which were swamping the Australian market forced production to end. Plans to build the four seat Aircruiser development (described under Millicer) were dropped. \r\n\r\nHowever New Zealand's AESL (Aero Engine Services Ltd) purchased the Airtourer design and production rights in early 1967. AESL (later NZAI and now PAC) built the Airtourer 115, the more powerful 110kW (150hp) model Airtourer 150, and constant speed prop fitted Super 150. Later the 115 became the T2, the 150 the T4 and the Super 150 the T5. The T3 was powered by a 95kW (130hp) RR Continental O-240, while the T6 was a militarised version based on the T5 built for New Zealand. NZAI production ceased in 1974. \r\n\r\nIn December 1997 Australia's Millicer Aircraft Industries purchased the Airtourer's production rights and it plans to deliver new build M-10-140 and M-10-160 Airtourers from 1999.

Many have since appeared in the west. \r\n\r\nThe four seat Yak-18T was the last production model, and the most extensively modified.

Aeroflot attached great significance to the Yak-40 program, as the aircraft was intended to operate regional services that accounted for 50% of Aeroflot's passenger traffic. \r\n\r\nA S Yakovlev (after whom the design bureau is named) led the Yak-40 design team, and the program's existence was revealed on October 21 1966, when the first prototype made its maiden flight. The type went into production in 1967 and entered service with Aeroflot in September 1968. Production continued until 1978, with 1011 built by the Saratov aircraft factory, of which 125 aircraft were exported to 18 countries.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Yak-40's most noticeable design feature is its trijet configuration, with three specially developed Ivchenko AI-25 two shaft turbofans. The three jet engine layout was chosen for increased redundancy (and hence better one engine out performance, allowing good short field performance). The unswept, high aspect ratio wing is also designed for good field performance. An APU and a ventral airstair in the rear fuselage allow autonomous operation at remote airfields. A high power-to-weight ratio allows the Yak-40 a good hot-and-high performance - operating economics was a lesser priority.\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Yak-40 remained basically unchanged during its production life, but a number of developments were proposed, including the Yak-40M, a 40 seat stretched development. For a time a US company, ICX Aviation, planned to build the type in the USA with western avionics and three Garrett TFE731 turbofans. The Yak-40TL twin engine conversion was also proposed. The main difference would have been the replacement of the Yak-40's three engines with two Lycoming LF 507s. \r\n\r\nThe Yak-40K is a cargo-passenger version with a port-side forward cargo door with a maximum payload of 3200kg (7055lb) in all freight configuration.\r\n\r\nThe Yak-40D has two additional fuel tanks to increase the total fuel capacity to 6000kg (13,200lb).

It flew for the first time on October 17 1967. The improved Z 42M meanwhile introduced a constant speed propeller and the larger tail developed for the Z 43 four seater, and replaced the Z 42 in production in 1974. \r\n\r\nDevelopment of the two seat line continued with the further improved Z 142, which flew for the first time on December 29 1979. Changes introduced included a larger cockpit canopy and faired undercarriage. The Z 142 remained in production in Z 142C form to the mid 1990s. The latest two seater of this family to be developed is the 150kW (200hp) Textron Lycoming AEIO360 flat four powered Z 242 L. Changes aside from the engine include a three blade constant speed prop and revised engine cowling profile. First flight was on February 14 1990. \r\n\r\nDevelopment of the four seat models, the Z 43 and Z 143, has followed that of the two seaters. The Z 43 appeared a year later than the Z 42, flying for the first time on December 10 1968. The Z 42 and Z 43 share the same basic airframe, but differ in that the Z 43 features a larger and wider cabin with seating for four, and a more powerful engine. The current Z 143 L flew for the first time on April 24 1992, and is similar in structure to the Z 242, but again differs in having a larger cabin with seating for four and a more powerful Textron Lycoming O-540 engine. \r\n\r\n"}]
